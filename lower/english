a month later an extraordinary birth took place on planet earth a person with unprecedented prophetic gifts was born the astrologers birth in the village took place at the very beginning of the renaissance in the french town of saint rémy de provence in a stately mansion behind the market halls where the merchants had been hawking their wares for some time the contractions had started reynière de nostredame had carefully calculated the date of birth but the onset of labor still came unexpectedly the little one probably had a slightly earlier birth in mind in order to meet the optimum position of the planets the noticeably large mucus plug which closes off the cervix during pregnancy had just come out this was the sign that showed the end of the pregnancy was nearing reynière lost some blood and asked for her father jean de saint rémy to come her father was the court physician of the good king rené the former count of provence she lay on the bed perspiring and her husband jacques who had risen to the status of notary public hurriedly entered along with her father the contractions were now coming regularly and were becoming more painful until at their peak they suddenly stopped her father looked worried and felt his daughters belly with a professional touch relieved the physician established that the unborn child was still moving and that reynière was losing amniotic fluid at a normal rate regular contractions returned and the membranes broke labor was now well underway slowly but surely reynières body made an opening for the baby to move through the cervix which during pregnancy is drawn tight was now gradually opening the peculiar newcomer was fighting as if his life depended on it and the expulsion stage was exhausting the labor would take as many as ten hours finally the little head emerged the wideopen eyes critically taking in the world jean and jacques were amazed and looked at each other with great joy the shoulders were next after which the rest of the little body slid out without any problems michel his mother proudly welcomed the wet little bundle jean carefully picked up the slightly bloody baby who was still attached to the umbilical cord and put him on the mothers belly the boy was born with a caul with the membranes wrapped around the head clairvoyant children michel de nostredame appeared at exactly high noon on december 14 of the year 1503 with the church bells of saint rémy loudly ringing in the background his parents were overjoyed with their first child who would have a safe future as a catholic jacques and reynière were both descended from old jewish families but several years earlier all jews had been forced under pain of death to convert to catholicism there was still a menorah on the table however symbolizing the jewish festival of lights hanukkah that was being celebrated that month for these special holidays the tradition was secretly honored and jacques always read from the talmud this time he ceremoniously addressed his newborn son surrounded by the entire family and told him that the talmud speaks about the wonder of hanukah michel securely wrapped in swaddling cloths only heard some paternal sounds when the little one crawling and later walking began to discover the world he showed himself to be a very curious little boy he wanted to investigate everything in sight and examine every object he enthusiastically attacked visitors and sometimes liked to play with their hair he quickly expanded his boundaries to outdoors where he ignored the other children his age he thought they were playing aimlessly round and round once he extinguished the fire in the fireplace with water and sat there looking at the clouds of steam with great fascination during his first visit to the market his gift came to light the family was walking past the booths displaying wares because of his limited height michel was amusing himself with what was going on underneath the wooden tables fish remains rotting fruit blood waste broken jute sacs an occasional rat chewing on things and countless shuffling feet his mother was keeping a close eye on him the nostredame family stopped at a booth with glassware and wanted to buy something pretty for the holidays in the previous century one only saw drinking glasses among the socially elite but nowadays glass was being produced on a larger scale which made it more affordable the eager market merchant quickly grabbed the most delicate bowl between his teeth trying to impress the young mother you know madam pottery and wood and tin dishes are functional but very ugly glass dishes are all the rage now reynière cheerfully listened to him while keeping her child close by there are several types of glass drinking cups available he continued look at this gorgeous cups with hollow funnelshaped stems and low chalicetype glasses with tall graceful stems behind them are cylindershaped cups decorated with polka dots and what type is this she asked those are berkemeiers madam drinking glasses with a funnel shaped cup and a finely ridged foot ring the merchant took everything out of the cabinet because the family looked like they had money to spend jacques thought the ridged one were quite nice the ridged ones are very popular the merchant repeated immediately besides the low drinking bowls cabbage stalks and berkemeiers of course what are those ridges for inquired reynière the ridges or polka dots ensure a better grip on the glass and which ones do you sell most of asked her husband the glass drinking dishes sell especially well pouring devices such as bottles are very expensive the specialist apparently was the only person in the area who possessed a grand collection of glassware and he proudly brought out his most beautiful bottle the family was getting completely entranced by his products and jacques asked the man if he could look at the bottle more closely little michel had been behaving himself in a most exemplary fashion all this time and was quietly looking at the halffilled boxes under the table above jacques grabbed the glass showpiece clumsily and it immediately slipped out of his grasp the expected crash however surprisingly didnt come and everybodys startled attention focused below there their son had just effortlessly caught the very expensive bottle he put the heavenly gift to his lips whereupon the owner quickly grabbed it out of his little hands after many apologies the disillusioned family went home without buying anything when they got there the father who got away with just a scare was full of praise for his son his parents left the boys upbringing to his grandfather with the erudite jean he was in good hands the former court physician and astrologer taught his grandson not only mathematics but also ancient greek latin and hebrew as well as the preliminaries of astrology jean often took him outside the village at night so they could lie in the field together and look up at the stars there he told him that you can see the northern sky better in the winter and the southern sky in the summer and that the winter constellations such as the canis major and canis minoris can be easily found using the star orion as a guide when i grow up i want to be a star too said his grandson funny you should say that i was just thinking about the story where someone gets punished by being put in the sky as a star its about orion who was chasing his seven sisters the pleiades the sisters felt threatened by the chase and prayed for help which caused the goddess of the hunt to come to their rescue and she killed their brother with one of her arrows then orion was placed in the sky as a star but i dont know if thats possible for people made out of flesh and blood too michel although i just remembered there is some mention of it in the old scriptures so who knows by the way the pleiades are visible with the naked eye look theyre right there and jean stretched his arm toward the black sky those stars look like theyre touching each other the boy remarked yes it does look that way but in reality they are very far away from each other replied the grandfather when spring came around grandpa showed michel the stars arcturus regulus and the sparkling spica the brightest stars in the spring sky which together formed the spring triangle that summer the stars were not very clearly visible and it wasnt until autumn that grandfather showed the winged horse pegasus which is often difficult to find because it is upsidedown through these little excursions michel got to know the constellations and his parents kept grumbling that he and his grandfather came home so late at night one clear evening when jean had once again taken his grandson out the weather suddenly changed and turned gloomy no celestial bodies were visible and michel cursed the dark clouds that were gathering that night the little rascal was tossing and turning in his bed which was separated from other sleeping places with long curtains and couldnt sleep he was still angry and disappointed when suddenly the window shutters blew open and a furious tornado pulled him out of his bed he just managed to grab hold of the window sill with his body dangling outside reynière was woken up at that very moment by maternal instinct shook her husband awake and together they ran to the child who was in mortal peril together the two of them pulled the child back into the room and shut the window tightly not really realizing what had happened they went back to sleep and a short time later the window was pulled open once more again the whirlwind directed its energy toward the gifted child with a seething fury but his parents were there in a heartbeat and defeated the catastrophe before he was sucked out of the room the shutters were nailed shut permanently this was a lesson their son would never forget no more cursing anyone or anything he resolved one day a message arrived from pierre de nostredame michels paternal grandfather pierre and his wife lived in grasse and invited the whole family to come and stay with them for a few weeks pierre had also been a court physician in the service of the son of the good king rené after his patient was murdered in barcelona pierre settled in the developing perfume town jacques and reynière decided to accept his invitation many preparations had to be made for the trip because grasse was not exactly next door and they had had four more children through the years all boys a busy household a few weeks later they were ready and they all climbed into the rented carriage which was pulled by a team of horses father mother and three sons jean stayed home with the two youngest ones after a few days they reached cannes and from there a path lead them inland toward grasse the landscape was surrounded on all sides by lush treecovered hills and invited them to take a break it would have been better if they hadnt because little hector immediately disappeared and it took three hours to find him in a crack in the rocks and guess who found him of course michel hector got a cuff on the ear and they continued on their way behind them they could still catch an occasional glimpse of the mediterranean sea there were not many flowers blooming in the perfume region summer was coming to an end and bees were looking for the last of the honey finally they saw grasse situated against a mountain slope surrounded by fields that would only display their flowers again in the spring when they entered the wealthy trading town the boys were very excited by all the sights there were all kinds of tanneries which their father told them used to spread a terrible stink not too long ago in order to dispel the penetrating scent of the leather the grassois got the idea to saturate the leather with a mixture of animal fats and flowers necessity is the mother of invention and in this way perfumed handbags gloves and belts turned into a true fashion rage the carriage bumped along laboriously past the many shops with displayed leather wares but finally they reached place aux aires where their grandparents lived bertrand passionately flung open the carriage doors to get out as quickly as possible and start horsing around but his father stopped him first youre going to greet your grandparents young man he said meanwhile pierre came walking up swaying and immediately began to lug the suitcases in despite his advanced age he was very vigorous and he still worked for the physicians guild after kissing grandpa the three brothers ran off into the perfectly unknown but oh so alluring city in great ecstasy just let them play for a while reynière said tiredly to her husband that will give us a chance to unpack our bags in peace the children meanwhile were parading past the many perfumers soapboilers distillers and other merchants grasse was a dazzling but also very dirty town and the open sewers could barely handle the mountains of waste nevertheless it smelled wonderful in the streets there were cases bags and balloons full of flower water oils wine lavender soap herbs and scented leather everywhere elevenyearold michel found himself in a virtual paradise for the senses and was soon enchanted with a specific scent that pulled him into an alley where are you going now bertrand and hector exclaimed surprised but michel wouldnt say and followed the narrow lane toward an archway that led outside of the town beneath the stone arc he stopped for a moment closed his eyes and smelled here the scent was at its strongest he deeply inhaled the peculiar odor which was sweet and dark at the same time a few minutes later he returned fulfilled and found his brothers playing in the square the days flew by in this fantastic town and tomorrow would be extra exciting they were to visit a wellknown perfumery grandfather pierre was friends with amalfi the proprietor of the factory she had promised him that his family could have a tour that morning they went among the potential buyers who had flocked from far and near and amalfi personally gave them a guided tour the distinguished people all saw hector elaborately picking his nose and father chastised him amalfi meanwhile told them all about her famous line of scents these azure flasks hold various types of eau de toilet and soliflores for women after her introduction the group shuffled towards the next table while the other son started to be troublesome bertrand tried to surreptitiously open the flasks dont touch those bertrand his father warned the madam fortunately didnt notice and continued soliflores are scent water made from only one type of flower plant or fruit after an elaborate listing of the assortment the guests followed her to another room where ingenious devices were set up these are our distillation alambics distillation was developed by the arabs while attentively listening michel and his grandfather heard hector whining at his mother that he needed to pee it distracted the factory owner from her story and she coughed agitatedly okay go outside quickly but be quiet reynière commanded her child jasmine originally comes from india and spanish sailors introduced the flower in grasse via northafrica not long ago maître gantier managed to get a monopoly on it continued madam this is a good opportunity to buy some perfume reynière whispered to her husband jacques idly agreed because he was completely caught up in taking care of the little ones fortunately they were hanging around pierre and were behaving themselves for the moment father even managed to catch the last part of the story when i compare it to jasmine from abroad i always notice that jasmin grassois has more depth and volume oh i could tell you so much more about our perfumery but it is time to finish the tour are there any questions or comments unexpectedly michel came forward with panache and asked if he could say a few words father was starting to get a headache from all the unpredictable behaviors of his youngsters whereas madam amalfi was quite charmed with the childish request and agreed michels heart started to beat faster the little prophet squared his shoulders and with great force pronounced his first prophesy some day this perfumery will be very famous this will be because of a student with an exceptionally good nose his name is montesquieu and he will produce three amazing scents at the height of his career he will create a bizarre perfume for himself with the scent of recently killed bodies of young girls after his death the success will decline with this the preteen ended his oration and walked back to his parents with dignity everyone was dumbstruck and even amalfi didnt know how to respond jacques decided not to chastise his son because the boy had followed all the rules of proper conduct no one mentioned the dark prophesy again they could not make any sense of it a little embarrassed about the behavior of his strange grandson pierre thanked the owner for the fascinating outing and the family returned home soon the vacation came to an end grandpa jean was very happy with their return especially because of michel with whom he had developed a special bond when the carriage rode into their street the rue des remparts the two immediately sought eye contact hector and bertrand were deadtired from the long trip and went straight to bed but michel was still excited about his performance feverishly he discussed his peculiar prophesy and his urge to speak out with his grandfather the strange scent in grasse had awakened something in him the preteen reported jean took him seriously and suggested that he would share all his insights relating to astrology with him but now michel had to go to bed it took hours before the sparkle in his mind diminished and he finally fell asleep a few months later grandpa found a suitable moment to further his eldest grandchilds education in astrology he decided to tell him all the ins and outs of it and took him up to the attic this was his personal domain and no one was allowed to snoop around in there uninvited especially not children because he was afraid his delicate instruments might get damaged or his papers lost from his easy chair grandfather told michel that he had managed to pick up an ingenious piece of equipment in paris a while back it consisted of two polished lenses in a pipe through which you could see very far thanks to this invention a whole new world has opened up for me he said and in my mind you are now old enough to enter into this world i foresee a great future for you you have exceptional mental capacities and that is why i am now going to tell you everything i know about astrology up till now i have never allowed anyone to be in this room without supervision but for you i am making an exception i hereby give you permission to use all of my instruments and books anytime you want to his grandfather got up and retrieved a large object from underneath a dusty cloth using this spyglass young man you can see the planets so closely that it seems like you are right there but first i will give you some theory before we explore the heavens his grandson was looking at the exciting device his eyes like saucers astrology looks for the relationship between events in the cosmos on earth and in humans but havent we already talked about this before michel shook his head no my memory is not what it used to be my boy through this research we are able to use information about one moment to trace a series of events which follow it in other words we can predict the future from it this is much more difficult than it seems since time immemorial it has been accepted that the sun the moon and the planets influence our lives here on earth grandfather got up again opened the attic shutter and placed the spyglass on its stand come and stand over here the sun has just set and we will probably be able to see several planets let me see if there it is look michel just above the last rays of the sun mercury the planet of the intellect and mental capacities his grandson looked through the device and discovered a pink planet that was twinkling jean continued as you know the earth rotates around the sun in one year and not the other way around as the church claims theyre also still insisting that the earth is flat and that you can fall off it poppycock they just prefer to keep their followers ignorant but doesnt the sun also make a circle every year yes but not around the earth but along various groups of stars those groups all together are called the zodiac for example there is gemini aries taurus etcetera im a sagittarius undeniably true my boy but it will take some time before the sun will pass by there because we are not currently living in the age of sagittarius grandpa peered through the spyglass again and continued his tale mercury is always near the sun and for that reason it not always clearly visible but tonight we are lucky and he passed the device over that planets not very exciting said michel while he peered through the lenses well you should see the moon and jean serenely looked up the celestial body in the cloudless canopy there was genuine love between grandfather and grandson perhaps because they were so much alike they both had the same interests and they were both of slight build only the youngest one still had his life stretching out before him and grandpa obviously didnt anymore this is what you want to see said jean and stepped aside wow exclaimed michel and gazed at the gigantic moon full of craters mountains and crevices someone is walking around on there grandpa haha thats funny even if that were possible it is too far away to be able to see such details i really do see him the boy insisted he is planting a flag with red and white stripes and stars jean made an unbelieving face and took over the spyglass there was his familiar moon much too far to be able to see a person on it i dont see what youre seeing michel maybe its something that will happen in the future anything is possible my boy but i can only talk about matters that i know something about i still wanted to explain to you how to cast a horoscope and they let the heavens be and sat down on the bed to calculate a horoscope you need a number of particulars namely the date time and place of your birth but the most important thing is the birth date let me show you your own horoscope as an example grandfather looked through a drawer in his desk and brought out a piece of paper covered with strange symbols is that mine let me see born in saint rémy on december 12 1503 yes this is yours it is actually the 14th the 14th i must have written it wrong at the top because i always check everything three times must be old age and grandpa apologized in any case you have a heavily loaded horoscope with three outer planets mars jupiter and saturn because of this fierce configuration you will need iron discipline in order to control the creative power if you dont succeed in this the power will turn destructive you mean like samson who made an entire temple collapse hmm thats not such a good comparison in any case you will have to learn to channel your energy and always remember that in every person there is as much good as evil and jean brought his attention back to the horoscope this picture here shows the twelve houses and but his voice suddenly faltered im tired he wheezed but if you want to learn more everything is described in that massive volume over there and he pointed towards a bookshelf grandfather was no longer approachable as time went on jean and michel became more and more devoted to each other they often spent the entire day at an old conventthe later institution where vincent van gogh stayed in 1890 that lay hidden a few miles south of saint rémy they spent hours reading original bibles michel learned above all to pray to the christian god and effortlessly followed the catholic scriptures despite his jewish background it is after all the same god as the one from the old testament he thought jean always hummed while they prayed at least when no one else was around from the priory when the weather was fine they foraged about in the surrounding lavender fields where they had found a mysterious half cavedin pyramidlike structure his wellread grandfather could comment on just about anything from ancient greek times he said about the structure while at the same time using it to take a rest michel by contrast was full of energy and went exploring in the area while jean took his customary little nap one day the boy came back excitedly a little ways over there there are all kinds of holes hacked out of the cliffs grandpa come and see but jean quietly stayed where he was and coolly explained that long ago goatherds had made those holes for their goats to protect them from predators apparently he had discovered them before one time he could barely get up and michel had to literally drag him home during adolescence the young man began to notice girls and this was a good opportunity for his mentor to speak about the marriage of two souls he explained how the male and female souls can merge together and the malefemale principle is represented everywhere in the universe you mean there are male and female planets too asked michel the planets are in principle all female thats why they call our planet mother earth answered jean and do we men have anything to say in the cosmos well the stars are male in contrast with dust and darkness wich are female these eternal polarities are also the essence of alchemy the boy spent the majority of his childhood outdoors with his grandfather and his parents didnt see much of their rapidly developing son they only got together at mealtimes it was not only michel and jeans fault they saw so little of each other jacques worked at the notarys practice all day and reynière besides running the household had her hands full with the youngest children sevenyearold antoine was a particularly challenging case because he always exhibited recalcitrant behavior for the rest michel got along well with his little brothers but play with them no there was little chance of that the seasons flew by very pleasantly until that one sad day they found dear old grandfather in his quarters he had died of old age michel had been watching him deteriorate for a while and knew the end was in sight nevertheless it was a devastating event it was drizzling on the day of jean de saint rémys funeral they took turns keeping vigil with the body in the house until it was brought out for the burial services all the family members were there old pierre and his wife had come all the way from grasse as well as jeans three sisters and cousins from nearby marseille the catholic prayer service took place in the church of selongey the families walked to the church where the coffin had been placed michels grandparents were walking so slowly that he had plenty of time to carefully observe the fancy houses with turrets at the place des halles finally they arrived at the church where many friends and acquaintances had gathered at the entrance a large man with reddish hair accidentally bumped into michel his shoes were covered in paint he was apparently not an invited guest but he wanted to go in michel didnt pay any attention to him and the funeral procession slowly moved through the gate with the imposing round arch door jacques and reynière were the first ones to stride past a row of pillars in the church and they were followed by michel and his four brothers in chronological order reynière was overcome with emotion and shed a tear for her father every now and then the public was seated at the wooden benches in the main chapel where the coffin was set up in the center the church of selongey had various chapels which were all lit by windows with bloodred divisions way up high was a painting of an apostle the last visitor had found a spot and priest bergé who was wearing a faded red shoulder covering began his sermon the funeral service was as everyone knew aimed at the purification and eternal rest of the soul of the deceased when someone has died this means that he has irrevocably taken his leave of this world this person will then be with god this is not an ending but a new beginning those who have lived good lives will go to heaven and those who have lived sinful lives will go to hell the transition from life to death is often not a harmonious passage but the lord protects us all because he understands the complicated lives of humans and accepts everyone as he is the priest then awkwardly leafed through his bible from behind his lectern and began to read a long drawnout passage in latin michel looked around and recognized the metal holywater font an upsidedown church tower in which one of his friends had once almost drowned candles were burning everywhere there were so many that even the tomb of the founder of the church in the front chapel was lit up his engraved image was visible at the entry jean had long ago managed to interest his grandson in art and culture and they had visited the church of selongey together a number of times michel knew the interior well and would have rather examined the murals than to have to listen to the droning sound of bergés voice or the armorplated vault in the sacrist of course he couldnt though he knew it would be perfectly fine with grandfather life before death he had always said finally gods servant praised the deceased for his charity in ordinary french and the visitors sat up straight again michel saw the carilloneur who was hard of hearing get up he was dying to get to his fortyeight church bells and start ringing them and began to climb up the stairs in the turret meanwhile the priest was sprinkling the body with holy water and scenting it with frankincense this was to indicate that the body of the deceased was in a state of holiness before god the acolyte said a few more prayers asking for forgiveness for jeans sins after the hymns the priest and his helpers strode out of the church and the pall bearers followed with the coffin all those gathered walked behind them the church bells were ringing and they all approached the cemetery in silence family friends and other interested people who had joined gathered around the grave that had been prepared and the pall bearers slowly lowered the coffin into it reynière quickly put a few flowers on the lid before the priest who was standing at the head silently blessed the grave and said an our father after he finished the prayer he threw a small amount of soil onto the coffin with the words earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust then everyone said goodbye to the jovial jean by adding their own scoop of soil onto the coffin and michel watched his deceased friend slowly disappear finally jacques thanked all those present for their sympathy and the family sadly returned home after the mourning period michel and mother visited grandfathers hallowed place up in the attic still feeling sad reynière opened the shutters to let the light into the room and then they took an inventory of the estate memories drifted up and her son stared unseeing through the attic window for a while feeling depressed this attic is so lifeless and desolate now he grumbled when mother was unexpectedly called downstairs by one of her children ill be right back michel and left him there alone from the attic window he had a good view of the town he discovered a new home about half a mile away that had been built without his noticing one of its windows was open it was a glass one unprecedented but it was too far away to see it very well i know i can use grandpas spy glass he suddenly realized and soon he could see every speck of the house then the youngster could not resist the temptation to sneak a look inside he saw a tall man with short dark hair who was passionately working at a painting easel why would anyone imitate sunflowers michel wondered in surprise the unknown person was standing in front of a canvas and repeatedly dipped his paint brush into the paint at one point he picked up another brush that he used for painting in finer detail and again glanced at the real sunflowers which were arranged carelessly on a table behind it suddenly the artist felt as if he was being observed and he turned around with a start the voyeur was startled out of his wits feeling caught although he couldnt possibly be seen he thought still it looked as though the stranger was staring at him albeit with a friendly look only then did michel realize that this was another peek into the future the other world dissolved almost instantly after this the house was also completely gone too bad no one to share my daydream with he thought sorrowfully a few months later michel who was sixteen by now went to avignon to study astrology his parents had reluctantly given him permission to make this unusual choice for his university studies avignon was only twenty miles away from saint rémy so he would be able to easily visit his parents and brothers avignon was a very important town because the papal palace was situated there from 1304 on there had been a series of french popes and these religious leaders all went to live in avignon because their chance of survival in rome was not great the french town and its surroundings had been papal property ever since jacques had heard from a client that mrs plombier whose husband had died of the plague six months earlier was moving to avignon with her daughters to live with relatives michel could get a ride provided that he would help the widow with her household goods that was no problem for him and they set a date mrs plombier had been cleaning her house that last week and all her possessions were packed up and waiting for her young fellow traveler michel knocked on her door on the day of departure and began to fill up the old rickety wagon according to her instructions with the nextdoor neighbors unexpectedly rolling up their sleeves as well the whole lot was quickly loaded the madame then took her place on the drivers seat and with the two girls they drove to the rue des remparts so their companion could say goodbye to his family they were all anxiously waiting while the widow who was not very experienced brought the horse to a halt michel jumped down from the wagon and embraced his father and mother the latter was looking very sad it seems like saying goodbye is becoming a regular occurrence reynière lamented with tears once again streaming down her beautiful face ill come and visit soon her son promised youd better said father who gave him a hug when the brandnew student had said goodbye to his brothers too it was time to leave everyone waved until the horse and wagon had disappeared from sight not far outside saint rémy it began to pour the rain was coming down in buckets and it got dark so fast it was scary the female driver fortunately was prepared for rain and with michels help she stretched a canvas over the wagon when lightning struck the horse became restless and the widow kept control of it with great difficulty her daughters aged five and seven were hunkered down deep beneath the canvas soon the path became barely passable because of the abundant amount of rain water and it looked like they might be in trouble halfway through the journey they could see frightening fires on both sides of the road bodies were being burned the plague the greatest disaster in the history of mankind had once again exacted its price and the horrifying disease raged through all of europe madame already knew as no other what those fires were for her husband had been cremated not long ago in order to prevent the plague from spreading more but she bravely held on and kept driving suddenly they heard shrieking in the distance someone seemed to be calling for help they decided to ignore it and to keep going it kept raining unusually fiercely and to make matters even worse a vicious wind began to howl the horse could scarcely get the wagon to move forward anymore and continually slipped in the mud it was getting tired and every meter was a victory gradually a violent storm developed and there were branches and shrubs flying across the road hell and damnation madame could occasionally be heard saying to herself they had to stop many times and then michel would drag the debris off the path after many hours of beastly weather they reached the papal region they were exhausted and completely drenched one more obstacle had to be faced crossing the rhône river with a strong head wind they arrived at the famous bridge of avignon so far mrs plombier and her traveling companion had been taking turns on the drivers seat but once they arrived at the bridge where the wind was dangerously powerful the widow preferred to keep control of the reins herself she was just about to encourage the horse to cross the angry water when michel suddenly shouted stop she immediately pulled hard on the reins which caused the horse to neigh and the wagon to come abruptly to a halt the youngest girl began to cry and her sister tried to comfort her what on earth is the matter their mother asked with astonishment de nostredame didnt say a word jumped off the wagon and landed in the mud then he plodded fearlessly through the storm to the bridge with his long coat flapping in the wind when he arrived at the stone connector he stood for a moment his eyes on the road he felt how the greatly swollen river streamed past the piles and walked back again what are you up to plombier called out all the stuff has to be loaded off the wagon he answered barely audible through the volatile wind are you crazy michel climbed up on the drivers seat and explained himself the bridge is about to collapse you idiot wagons have been crossing it for years she said irritably the student jumped down from the wagon in protest and sat down in the mud with his arms folded across his chest after a short deliberation she decided she might as well obey all right as long as youre willing to do the work she demanded upon which the young man began to drag the suitcases to the other side right away mother meanwhile retrieved her children from under the canvas and clasped together they followed their peculiar traveling companion on the other side of the river the little family looked for shelter beside a cliff while michel went back to the horse and wagon when after much plodding he had brought over all of the household belongings he tied a long rope to the horse and walked to the bridge with it above them threatening clouds rushed past and the horse refused to come along michel spurred it on with firm tugging movements hesitantly the frightened horse stepped forward and the wagon slowly began to move they approached the ageold bridge which looked totally solid and showed no sign of any defect and the student led the horse and wagon across it after the very smooth crossing madame made a sour face and refused to say another word to him after the wagon had been loaded up again the journey continued finally they were approaching the big city they arrived just before sundown and not much later they were sitting warm and safe in front of a crackling fire with the plombier family after a good meal and a nights rest their paths would separate the youth expressed his thanks for the hospitality and carrying his things he started to walk towards the university in the city center the mayor was announcing some hot news and the student joined the gathering crowd which was flocking near the announcer theatrically unrolled a parchment the bridge of avignon has collapsed he began seven people were killed tonight the bridge was once destroyed in 1226 as you can see the lord does not wish this bridge to be here our bridge builder bénézet from days gone by has wrongly been declared a saint it was now completely crowded with people and many of them blocked michels view but he had heard enough and strolled away a harsh atmosphere pervaded in avignon whose history started high on the cliff by the river the city once the center of a celtic tribe hated visitors his grandfather used to talk about the mercilessness of the avignois a long time ago in paris they argue in avignon they will stick a knife in you he had said avignon was situated on the wellknown via agrippa the main road between cologne lyon and arles in the parc des papes michel sat down on a park bench to calm his mind he concentrated on the old oaks in front of the university before his initiation into it the freshman had been having a lot of dreams lately and sometimes he couldnt tell his dreams from real life anymore he would have to find some technique to create clarity in this maybe his astrology studies would give him the aid he sought after his small indulgence in navelgazing he went to meet his teachers and at their advice he moved into a small room in the rue stagricol a little street not far away from that day on he walked to the school building every day through the inner city from the rocher des doms he had been able to map out the city quite well the rocher des doms was the cliff that stuck out above everything and from which the city was easy to explore michel usually preferred to saunter along the large boulevards because there he could ponder his studies better he got along well with a number of students although they were soon often jealous of the exceedingly intelligent young man at the esoteric school he gathered useful knowledge for the first few months he learned that man possesses various bodies a total of seven the physical vital astral and mental bodies and at a higher lever the causal buddhi and atma bodies he was taught that these represent seven levels of consciousness and that the planets and stars are also made up of them all of these bodies are connected to each other and are present in every person in at least a dormant form the visible material body is the crudest type the vital body holds the material together and provides the energy required the astral body is connected to the emotions and reveals itself primarily in the dream world the mental body represents thinking and the causal body only develops itself when thinking has completely plumbed the depths of cause and effect buddhi is understood to be the state where a person truly awakens and atma is the breath of life a condition that is achieved when a someone becomes one with the allthatis and the individual aspect is dissolved it was an exciting theory but there were no practical examples one day the industrious firstyear student went to the place de lhorloge around five oclock in the morning to do his exercises the square was still pristinely clean at that time of day and there was no one there to bother him after finishing his exercises he walked through the streets in good spirits and had arrived outside the city wall when several carriages with guards surprisingly came driving up a mysterious stopover took place because several large men hurriedly began to exchange the usedup horses for fresh ones moreover inside one of the parked carriages sat a small fat man decorated with many badges who was wedged tightly between two solidlooking guards that guy must have committed some kind of crime the student understood the convoy had obviously arrived so early so as not to attract any unwanted attention the changing of the horses and stocking up of provisions took some time meanwhile michel was looking at the prisoner with fascination that man must have illusions of grandeur he exuded the air of an emperor suddenly there was a great commotion hordes of avignois rushed from de porte st lazare upon the carriages wanting revenge on the small corporal from corsica the city guard tried to control the riot but there was no stopping the furious citizens and they surrounded the carriage in the center they called the decorated prisoner every name in the book other insurgents threw rocks at him or threatened him with their swords a few minutes later several people jumped onto the carriage climbed inside and started to tear off his badges of honor an officer who arrived in a hurry managed to calm the heated tempers after which the last horses were quickly hitched the besieged carriage with the small corporal managed to escape after a guard succeeded in pulling a few fanatics off the wheels the rest of the carriages had been left alone and were able to follow their course uninterruptedly afterwards the student was reflecting on the event hey asshole are you growing roots there or what a workman suddenly swore didnt you see that riot just now asked michel i only see a stranger and we dont like those here and he continued on his way rolling his barrel it was the old avignon mentality and the strange riots1814 the dethroned emperor napoleon nearly stoned in avignon turned out to have been nothing but hallucinations after the first trimester the teachers were full of praise for the young de nostredame that was very nice but the gifted student was not learning very much from them his grandfather had already taught him so much about astrology that it was impossible for his teachers to add much to it the disappointed michel therefore didnt expect them to expand his knowledge much fortunately there was a threestorey library that was the most beautiful one he could ever imagine he liked to pass the time in there and examine the ancient texts the teachers encouraged the genius to research related areas they instructed mr grimbert the librarian who due to some illness was always shivering to gather together a list of books for the student grimbert has set up the literature in a separate part of the library where the young man could go about his business without being disturbed michel devoured the stack of documents in a short time aside from a few works by grandfather the only book he had studied in depth was the bible and the change of fare was very welcome in the end there was really only one manuscript that really spoke to him this was an essay about alchemy it seemed like a cliché but who didnt see images of an old bearded wizard performing strange experiments in a dusty old lab when they heard the word alchemy the book contradicted his preconceived notions and he wanted to go more deeply into the subject matter in the manuscript in question it said that alchemy was introduced in spain by the arabs after the crusades and so he scrutinized the spanish department for days on end during his search he came upon an eyecatching article written by artephius in the twelfth century entitled the art of increasing the lifespan of man the spanish article was written in latin which he was familiar with curious he began to read it i artephius have learned all the arts in the magical book of hermes during my long life i have seen people who wanted to perfect alchemy however i did not want to write down anything that would make the laws more accessible to a broader audience because they may only be revealed by god or a master it is therefore useful to read my book only if one possesses broad knowledge and a free spirit i once was like others jealous i have now been alive for about a thousand years ultimately by the grace of god alone that man is as old as methuselah michel thought excitedly he was determined to read those two books but indefatigable as he was in his search he did not find them that one by hermes probably doesnt even exist he thought and he consoled himself by reading all the alchemical literature he could find in one of the works he read that metal can be changed into gold using a mystical object the socalled philosophers stone the stone had been sought after for centuries but was never found and in the thirteenth century most alchemists had given up on it another manuscript told that alchemy can have a medical effect if one ingested exactly accurate proportions of salt sulfur and mercury it could have a positive effect on ones health the greek philosophers thales and aristotle believed that earth water air and fire were the basic elements from which everything material could be created another essay spoke about a fifth basic element the essence but for now he had read enough and he put the books away thanks for your help mr grimbert see you tomorrow another day had flown by and the tired student went back to his austere room in the rue st agricol after cooking and eating some warm mush he meditated on the book of hermes without any effect and then tried out the philosophers stone but unexpectedly fell asleep that night his desires were fulfilled the searching soul was touched by something magnificent and powerful and with a shiver he sat up straight in his bed michel de nostredame i am the one you are looking for i am hermes the son of zeus and maia the daughter of atlas one of the titans right before him sat a radiant powerful athletic being wearing a winged hat and holding a golden staff entwined with snakes hermes continued i am the leader of the three worlds i was born in a cave in arcadia i am the fastest of all the gods and the god of thieves the egyptians call me toth the romans call me mercury i am hermes trismegistus from genesis i am the hope of the stones the philosophers stone and the emerald tablet my material brother your fate has been determined you will play a role in the cosmic drama that will unfold on earth during the coming millennia but for now until the moon is mature you will go in another direction in order to allow your slumbering knowledge to be awakened by black death hermes vanished as quickly as he had appeared and left behind an enormous emptiness michel could not cope with the powerful supernatural confrontation and collapsed he did not wake up until the next afternoon feeling awful he got up and stumbling picked up his school bag so he could get back to studying but it was much too late to go the university and feeling confused he sat back down on his bed i feel so wretched he groaned with great difficulty he reconstructed the message from hermes but he could not absorb it all meanwhile his father  driven by higher powers  was in saint rémy worrying about the less than practical education of his son although astrology had become an acknowledged science there was not much you could do with it he discussed it with reynière who initially stayed supportive of michels choice but jacques kept harping on the fact that there was no future in it and she finally had to admit that the disadvantages outweighed the advantages they wrote a letter to their son in which they expressed their concerns and suggested that he consider a study in the field of medicine after all both of his grandfathers had been physicians michel received their mail the next day and read their suggestion to change the course of his studies he was pleasantly surprised and thought about hermes who had spoken about a change of direction so medicine is my destiny he concluded the next day he carefully approached his teachers because he did not want discredit them in any way during the parting discussion it turned out that they sympathized with his parents arguments and he left his studies in avignon on friendly terms after a short stay with his family he left for the next university in montpellier welcome mr de nostredame the caretaker greeted him most charmingly when he came in i will take you to the lecture hall right away because you are the last one to arrive and the stout woman got up from her stool with some difficulty and showed him the way they walked through the main hallway and turned a corner at the end the lecture will begin momentarily and will be given by dr hache she informed him the lady brought him to the back room where she showed him a spot at a table beside a young man with extraordinarily lively eyes professor hache unlike the caretaker did not take the trouble to welcome his students and began his lecture without delay thousands of years ago the first doctors tried to cure their patients by drilling a hole in their heads he said françois the person seated next to michel pointed to his forehead condescendingly precisely that is where that gesture originates said hache who noticed but it really wasnt such a crazy idea because in this way they wanted to allow the evil spirits which they thought were the cause of illness to escape from the body this was also called trepan a student from toulouse put up his hand questions may be asked at the end of my lecture the professor said later in ancient greek times a sick person would go to a temple and make animal sacrifices to aesculapius the god of healing afterwards the patient would drink healing water as well as bathe in it and then follow a strict diet the same student again raised his hand what did i just tell you said the teacher im just trying to let an evil spirit escape from my arm clarified the student trying to be funny please leave hache said unexpectedly strict the student got up crestfallen and left the room stupid jokes are not tolerated here and the professor continued his speech in four hundred bc the greek physician hippocrates lays the foundation for our scientific medical science he says that illness is not caused by sorcery but by nature and can only be cured by her his pupils were now keeping close ranks and no one dared make another sound around two hundred ad galenus also a greek physician taught us that the body contains four types of fluids or humors blood phlegm yellow bile and black bile and that they must be in balance with each other thats it for the introductory history now is the time to ask questions but briefly the students hesitated for a few moments do women have the same amount of blood phlegm and bile as men someone asked were not exactly sure about that but when these humors are out of balance men and women both get sick he answered my mother sure spews a lot of bile anyway a basque fellow commented she must be sick hache supposed not really shes as fit as a fiddle in any case i cant make a diagnosis from a distance fortunately we have advanced far beyond galenus and we conduct scientific studies by cutting open human bodies among other things so if your mother is nearby the blood drained from the basques face when he heard his teachers serioussounding suggestion you mean you cut open live people too he asked certainly but that happens only rarely we primarily study cadavers and make elaborate drawings of them due to these studies we have gained innumerable insights and many people can be cured of presentday diseases what methods currently exist to cure diseases michel now asked for instance with medications that are processed into liquids powders or tablets the lecturer answered unfortunately there are many quacks herbalists and witches who pose as pharmacists another very effective method is phlebotomy or bloodletting which allows the disease to drain out of the body this is my specialty question period came to an end and there was an afternoon break after this hache lectured uninterruptedly until sundown in the evening after a cheap meal in the cafeteria michel and his classmates left the university building to go home feel like walking through town someone who caught up to him at the notredamedestables church called it was françois rabelais the student with the lively eyes who sat next to him in class it sounded like a good idea to michel and they walked through the town and quickly became friends françois turned out to be a masterful story teller who wore his heart on his sleeve everywhere they went he named everything in such a frank and unusual way that many would have blushed just listening to it the rebel literally had no qualms about discussing anything he talked about heretical matters painful emotions or body parts that people usually avoided mentioning and when he found that michel responded too seriously to something he suddenly acted like a little child or became surprisingly obscene françois for his part was deeply impressed by michels enormous amount of knowledge the student from saint rémy seemed like a walking encyclopedia in a pub michel told about his jewish background his education from his grandfather and finally about the interrupted studies in avignon then were both in the same boat said françois what boat his classmate asked surprised well jews and kathars are both considered a threat to the catholic religion youre a jew and im a kathar how can you be kathar kathars were the last gnostics of course his lordship would know françois grinned we as true christians no longer practice our religion in public but underground in montpellier there are actually quite a lot of fellow believers my father runs a restaurant over there where meetings are held once in a while in secret of course ill bring you there some time if you want sounds interesting im curious to know what you people preach gnostics always had a very wellfounded argument because of their thorough study of the latin bible among other things right and thats why the catholic leaders hate us so much the kathar added is that the only reason your religion is prohibited no we are individualists and our holy books have been translated directly from the gospel the foundation of the church on the other hand is based on power and their message is about the original sin oh well popes bishops and priests often interpret the bible to suit their own purposes but in principle we all believe the same thing was michels opinion rabelais cast some doubt on his findings we have our own laws and we dont believe that one single being created all good and evil like the catholics do furthermore we are for individual freedom equality of women and against any form of violence theyre not i was talking about the original greek bible michel clarified in there such points of view are not refuted hmm that may be im not as learned as you are after the foundation course at the medical university the two friends effortlessly passed to the next grade the class had shrunk to thirty students by then and today they were to have their first practicum professor hache was standing on his platform and was wringing his hands in anticipation gentlemen we always begin the second year with a practical demonstration of bloodletting this will be performed by me personally on a person who has been declared incurably ill dont worry there is no black death involved what is the black death asked michel pointedly its a nickname for the plague my dear fellow but dont keep interrupting me i hope for all of you that you wont faint because it is a bloody business ive gotten used to it his colleagues carried in a woman with a seriously yellow complexion who was tied to a chair she was too weak to sit up the patient could no longer look straight ahead and her eyes wandered in all directions for the rest there was not much to her and she was uttering uncontrolled sounds she was a poignant case and a commotion started in the room i understand you feel compassion for her and you undoubtedly think im being somewhat heartless said the professor but this experiment is in the service of science and the end justifies the means moreover i assure you that this lady will receive some financial compensation the bully moved closer to the guinea pig and picked up where he left off there are two ways we can perform bloodletting the first one is to cut into a blood vessel and he pointed to a suitable spot on the patients forearm the second method is to place leeches he took a number of glass pots out of his pockets and showed various specimens today i will demonstrate only the first one these little creatures are already sated anyway for the first method the patient needs to squeeze a stick in his fist this causes the veins to swell and speeds up the process of the phlebotomy unfortunately this lady is too weak for this and we will have to cut deeper and he brought the lancet out of his doctors bag are there any volunteers to try this with me he asked no one dared say yes so he appointed someone mr de nostredame would you be so kind his student obediently got up and walked towards him make a cut right here lengthwise his teacher commanded while handing him the blades shouldnt i wash my hands first michel asked wash hands what for if youre afraid to do it i will do it myself sir françois bravely interrupted what my study partner means is that if the monk the flabby kind does not work the land the farmer will not guard the land as doctor he does not teach or preach to the people so the warrior does not heal the sick do you understand hache didnt understand a word of it um right he lied and he viciously made a deep cut into the forearm himself as expected little blood flowed out and he skillfully collected it in a glass bowl michel just let him be and returned to his spot after staunching the wound the woman still served as an overview for the arteries which had to always be avoided after this she was removed when closing the practicum the professor looked around with satisfaction and asked if his students had any speculation about the future of medicine michel was the first one to put up his hand ah the inquisitive but frightened student go ahead hache teased i could see people using body parts in the future his student proposed i thought you were a serious kind of person yes i am apparently not the teacher denied i do try to be michel insisted no one is interested in unsubstantiated nonsense stories obviously i cant give a scientific basis sir but you were asking for speculations werent you okay that is quite enough leave your rubbish out of my class from now on the teacher said insulted after school michel asked françois what he meant when he was talking about the monk of the flabby type oh nothing really i was only trying to test the thinking capacity of that ogre he said carelessly gee you can be mean sure can rabelais laughed without being the least bit embarrassed and on the way home they discussed the usefulness of hygiene one evening the two friends were being treated to a plate of mussels by françois father in his restaurant the place was filling up with fellow believers and they were fervently chattering with each other a little later there would be prayers in the back room and the jewish student had been invited to join in françois meanwhile confessed he has been busy translating italian medical letters thats ambitious michel said and thats not all i am also writing my debut novel les horribles et espouvantables faict et prouesses du très renommé pantagruel an impressive title perhaps a bit long though his friend opined maybe ill just call it pantagruel then but to change the subject are you someone who indulges in selfgratification excuse me do you masturbate de nostredame surreptitiously looked around to see if anyone was listening now youre really going too far françois thats none of your business he said angry hey i only wanted to prepare you for the mystical lesson youre about to hear what are you talking about michel asked confused well there is not only going to be praying but gnosis or holy knowledge is also going to be revealed and this time it is about sexuality they were interrupted by the noise of the mixed company that was moving to the back room apparently it was time for the gathering and the two young men followed to the private room where everyone was taking place on thick carpets after a short prayer a volunteer stood up to give the lecture and he brought out a stack of papers tonight i will be speaking about the hermes cups he announced holy cow michel said to himself the son of zeus and maia the messenger of the gods the man showed a mystical image of the human body to clarify what he was talking about in the head there were two symbolic overflowing cups and from the sacrum a pair of snakes crept up around the spine towards the opened wings at the height of the heart as everyone knows the old scriptures teach us to treat our sexual powers with great care but why have we been taught for ages to behave chastely the answer is different from what the church deludes us with go forth and multiply it preaches its easy to get new recruits among your own offspring eager for power the church leaders have obscured and twisted the gospel in order to keep the real reason hidden the old scriptures only say do not lose any seed in other words never allow it to be lost not even during the act of love michel looked at françois in surprise so thats what the funny guy had been alluding to the holy objective of gnosis is enlightenment of the individual the mystic continued and the coming home of the soul to the divine nature this drawing shows the sexual transmutation of the ens seministhe human sperm this delicate knowledge is only taught at mystical inauguration schools such as the one in montpellier the pharaohs of the old egypt were some of the people who were instructed in this the technique requires the utmost selfcontrol of sexual powers during lovemaking between man and woman especially for the man by withholding the semen during the melting together of the two souls a divine spark can be created which can be compared to an actual ignition ignatius in latin which is where the word gnosis originated the spark is created by the induction between the male and female sexual organs and produces a supernatural power which rises up along the spinal column hence the two twisting snakes the reborn energy reaches up to the top of the socalled caduceus of mercury through these channels and there opens the wings of the spirit the energy or kundalini can rise further up to the hermes cups but only if there is true love if this is present the cups are gradually filled when they are full they overflow and the energy slowly flows down the front to the heart after repeating this process seven times man is completely developed the mystic put the drawing away now i ask you all to rise the believers all stood and started to recite the standard prayers françois sang along with full conviction finally after fifteen religious mysteries had been contemplated the service was completed and tea was served at the end of the evening the two students evaluated the material in the now abandoned room i thought you had stooped to obscenity again before the service michel apologized but i was truly fascinated with what they were saying i knew you would find it interesting françois answered it sure was but it does make life seem like punishment well the fruits can be picked during ones lifetime and if you apply this technique properly you can cultivate special powers nature will listen to you you mean i could talk to a horse the invited guest asked frivolous for instance are you serious or are you playing with me no seriously the red sea opened for moses didnt it rabelais indicated then everyone should apply that technique as soon as possible better not hardly anyone is pure enough and you can create a lot of havoc with bad intentions those are the brothers of darkness watch out for them michel let everything sink in for a while are children still conceived among practitioners of this technique he then asked they are still being delivered by the stork oh great the stupid jokes are back and making a long face michel got up to leave sorry sorry ill answer your question seriously ordinary mortals are having enough babies to preserve our population besides very advanced children are often born of initiates i suppose the transcendence of lust is the basis of this his guest speculated indeed once upon a time eve ate the forbidden fruit and ever since then man has been banished from paradise now we have to move mountains to repair her mistake forbidden fruit forbidden fruit is symbolic for male sperm françois explained drinking a last cup of tea but do you play with yourself or dont you his friend shook his head sadly and walked out of the room incorrigible that rabelais after several years of intense cramming michel got permission to establish himself as a physician his studies were not completed yet but he definitely wanted to go and help the plague victims in the country in the back of his mind he always held the thought that the black death would awaken his dormant insight according to the message from hermes the nineteenyearold physician told françois about his intention who regretted it but agreed that his friend was ready for the real work and what will you call yourself françois asked just doctor de nostredame you know that scientists embellish their names with a latin ending dont you yes but  michel hesitated not wanting to be vain its important the make an impression you know what do you think of nostradamus sounds great his buddy laughed submitting to the idea a few days later the two friends bade each other farewell and promised to keep in touch michel returned to his parents home so that from saint rémy he could offer his knowledge in the surrounding areas they were very happy with the return of their son and father spontaneously offered him grandpas attic shouldnt you discuss that with julien first reynière cautioned her husband julien only studies up there but michel is going to be bringing in money he retorted youre just walking all over that boy she disapproved all right ill ask him what he thinks julien who was studying law up in the attic had no problem with making room for his eldest brother as it turned out and he moved back into his former room along with his books his older brothers presence was good for him too he could now help him translate texts alls well that ends well michel was happy to see his family again his last visit had been a year ago and he observed the familiar goingson with a broadened mind his little brothers had grown into strapping lads and were about to leave the nest and go out into the wide world bertrand wanted to be a carpenter most of the woodwork in the house was made by him he definitely didnt want to be a notary like his father because he has a deformed forehead from all that brainwork he claimed father did indeed have a strange forehead it was flat high and stuck way out his hands by contrast were exceptionally nicely shaped in addition jacques was a bit stuffy he always considered everything in the minutest detail his wife was more in touch with her intuition michel noticed for the first time what an attractive woman his mother was she had a great figure beautiful warm eyes and long shiny brown hair which she usually wore up it was a pity that she was a bit too trusting with strangers a few times money had disappeared in her presence father on the other hand had a healthy dose of suspicion in that regard so the two completed each other quite well the other brothers hector and antoine didnt know what they were going to do yet i know im going to make some matzo reynière said breezily in reaction to all the heavy plans for the future want to help me michel then you could tell me what youve been up to in montpellier at the same time and the young physician willingly went with her in the kitchen they mixed water with some flour okay tell me she commanded and her son began to tell her all about his student days oops i still have to stoke the fire in the back garden she interrupted him you go ahead and start kneading ill be right back a few minutes later she returned covered in soot and michel continued his narrative as if he hadnt noticed anything many college stories later the scent of the unleavened bread filled the whole house father cut the crunchy matzo at the table and in this way they celebrated the homecoming of their successful son would you visit a sick acquaintance of mine jacques asked afterwards thats the city chirurgeons job isnt it michel asked well i dont have a lot of faith in him mr delblondes health is steadily declining okay ill go and have a look his son promised by the way the municipality of arles is looking for a physician reynière just remembered you should go and apply there i will mother thanks for the tip the next day he visited mr delblonde who had been in the medical care of villain for some time this chirurgeon took care of your wounds cut away swellings performed phlebotomy pulled teeth prepared herbal remedies and cut your hair or shaved your beard the longterm patient had had the misfortune not to qualify for free treatments his illness had been dragging on and on and he had been obliged to sell the one family heirloom he possessed a root wood wardrobe in order to be able to pay the bills only people who were completely destitute were eligible for free services and the municipality covered these cost michels suspicions were confirmed when he entered villain was of the old school delblonde was completely exhausted due to laxatives and various fontanelles the patient was lying in bed in critical condition with a sister by his side nostradamus introduced himself and the old man thought he remembered him from the past half delirious he began to talk about the old days but his sister put a stop to it right away lets not waste any time doctor she said and she told him that her brother had gotten much worse after the incisions in the skin had become infected villain was trying to release an excess of humors this way michel examined the patient and gave his diagnosis i dont think that the cause is serious but the medical treatment is if you want your brother to stay alive those incisions must be closed and you must get rid of those purgative drinks he insisted the despondent sister realized that it was time for a change and she agreed michel immediately removed the iron tubes from the dozens of fontanelles and cleaned the wounds with water also give your brother fresh fruit and vegetables every day the doctor advised as he was leaving as soon as he is a bit stronger i will be back at city hall they were furious when they heard about this illegal practice they instructed the police to pick up the charlatan but he showed them his papers which proved that he was an acknowledged physician and that he had every right to treat any patient in france the city council members were still going berserk and were claiming that there was room for only one chirurgeon in saint rémy but nostradamus held his ground and there was nothing they could do about it within a week mr delblonde began to regain his strength and the controversial physician told him he should now start to take short walks the patient did as he was told and walked around the town for the first time in months his health continued to improve by leaps and bounds and everyone in town witnessed his surprising cure the city chirurgeon as well as the council members looked like fools and michels name as physician was established within a few days sick people started to knock on the de nostredames door and the miracle doctor treated all of them with good results after villain in the course of time had made a few big blunders michel was appointed as the official new physician of saint rémy the swearingin ceremony had barely taken place when there was a sudden massive outbreak of the plague in the camargue the district council reported that there were thousands of victims in the area and the brand new chirurgeon was now facing a huge challenge the pestilence was extremely contagious and if you had a family member who had the disease the same fate as a rule was awaiting you within two to six days you could be dead and buried dogs cats chickens and even horses were also its victims but the young physician was resilient and thought he was immune fortunately saint rémy had not been hit with an outbreak of the plague as yet but the nearby village of sainte doffe had been and public life had come to a grinding halt there dead bodies were rotting in the streets or tossed into hastily dug graves by shattered loved ones the unbearable stench of rotting flesh hung in the air and people were burning fragrant pieces of wood in an effort to dissipate it many villagers had kicked their family members out of their homes to try to save their own lives others had fled elsewhere michel visited his first plague patient in this plagued village and was brought to a deathly ill child in a little clay hut the little boy was spitting up blood had big black spots and lumps as large as eggs all over his body his mother was sprinkling the floor with vinegar to freshen the air the brave doctor examined the child but truth be told there was really nothing he could do no remedy had yet been found for this disease at the university they were advising to perform bloodletting but michel wanted nothing to do with such backward practices just to give the family some hope he placed a piece of devils dung around the childs neck an herb that was used in exorcism he wrote down the symptoms of the extremely contagious disease and left without being able to do anything substantial during the days that followed the physician visited several plague sufferers who were initially taking shelter in spiritual peace with god wherever he came in there was always some anxious priest who would be taking confession and promising the patient a place in the hereafter medical help unfortunately took second place ignorance is a cardinal sin michel realized more than ever however the abundance of superstition the abuse of power and the ignorance stimulated him to attempt to discover the cause of the disease by using his common sense and to find a solution for it he distinguished two types of plague the one with lumps forming on the outside of the body and the one affecting the lungs after examining the symptoms of the disease he could see the importance of hygiene which in the jewish religion had been traditional for centuries an interesting case in milan confirmed his findings the archbishop had ordered to brick up the first three houses that had been attacked by the plague with the residents inside as a result of this milan was protected from a further outbreak this harsh management had shown that contagion was being passed on invisibly nostradamus began to introduce quarantine for new cases during which time no healthy citizens were permitted to have any contact with the patients who were still being provided with food and water this method began to yield some good results the researcher also had the idea that the disease could be carried by the wind and he therefore distributed masks among the population in a neighboring village that had not been contaminated with the plague yet the residents were spared from the epidemic and michel began to suspect the existence of bacteria he then began to advise everyone to take a bath in warm water once a week if at all possible and to wash their hands with soap before each meal he also stimulated them to regularly brush their teeth for example with chewed up licorice root to rinse the mouth with honey water or wine vinegar to clip th eir finger nails and cut and wash their hair moustaches and beards everyone also had to change their clothing and thoroughly clean it by washing it preferably in hot or boiling water despite the essential pioneer work he nevertheless remained a voice calling out in the wilderness until pope clemens vii heard about the willful plague fighter and invited him to his private quarters in avignon the pope asked him how he should protect himself against a future outbreak of the plague and michel advised him to at least withdraw into his residence when the epidemic reached the neighborhood of the religious leader about a month later he spent several weeks in solitude because of the isolation he stayed alive and nostradamus gained some fame the plague meanwhile was raging through all parts of the country and exacted a terrible toll in all of europe the overpopulated areas were hit the hardest armies of welltrained strong soldiers fell apart after a few days of the epidemic and local wars were lost before being fought quacks tried to take advantage of the panic situation and make a quick fortune the young doctor worked day and night and treated thousands of people after four years the plague had finally spent its fury and nostradamus returned to montpellier to finally complete his studies françois had graduated by then and surprisingly had left france the caretaker told him strict measures had been taken against the reformed the humanists and all dissidents even scientists with sharp tongues were no longer welcome in the country in spite of this françois had the good fortune to be employed as a physician by the viceroy of piemonte michel once again attacked his studies but he came upon a lot of incomprehension among his former teachers regarding his progressive ideas his theoretical and practical knowledge was so impressive however that the teachers could not deny him his doctors title a year later the unconventional physician gave lectures at this university for a short time but his treatment methods ultimately caused too much consternation the directorinchief took action the culprit was admonished and thereupon left the university tried and tested michel returned home to saint rémy and there decided to resume his practice theres no place like home jacques said after the umpteenth return of his son but michel didnt respond to his corny remark youve changed boy youre so quiet im getting older father he replied tersely michel had completely outgrown his parents but he didnt want to hurt their feelings and didnt say anything else there had been extra space in the house for a while and the physician decided to once again move into the abandoned attic julien was now studying law in aixenprovence and bertrand and his wife were living in a house he had built himself at the edge of town hector and antoine were still living at home and were hoping to hear new stories from their worldly brother but he didnt seem to be in the mood to talk michel had been through a lot and his mind had become too heavy and too powerful for wasting time in fact it had become so heavy and forceful that it was getting cloudy the mystical veil protected his higher bodies in their development and it made him inaccessible and when anyone pulled this blanket off him his look could burn you the learned family member badly needed rest and resigned himself to the character changes in himself today the fearless physician went to visit some patients in nearby arles after a pleasant little trip through the sunny scenery the carriage stopped in front of a yellow house near the town center nostradamus knocked and waited but there was no response the shutters were open and he glanced inside the doctors here he called out in a clear voice but there was still no sign of life he decided to try knocking loudly on the front door one more time before climbing in through the window when suddenly he was approached from behind by a scrawny man with reddish hair the man whose shoes were covered with paint carelessly pushed him aside and entered the house whoa wait a minute im visiting a patient here the doctor said but the man who was missing his left ear seemed deaf and mute and rudely slammed the door shut in his face well thats never happened to me before michel thought feeling somewhat humiliated im being treated like dirt here still in a funk the generally wellrespected physician walked through arles which possibly was one of the most beautiful cities in france nostradamus had some extra time because of the strange incident and ordered a cool drink at place du forum which was littered with cafés sitting on a wicker chair he observed what was going on in the street while he quenched his thirst the provincial town was known for its cultural manifestations and was visited by many wealthy italians and spaniards the foreigners were noticeable because of their expensive clothing and different looks it was an enjoyable spectacle and drew a lot of attention a little while later an italian lady walked towards him from a shopping street and he was instantly taken with her he guessed her to be about twenty years old a few years younger than himself the italian woman had a small beautiful head a long neck and sparkling eyes and she moved very elegantly the physician stared at the charming lady who looked to be highborn and he was unable to avert his gaze she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen and his heart was pierced by cupid most people did not show off their beauty but italians did the lady was walking around wearing very conspicuous clothing she was wearing a purple velvet gown with puffed sleeves and an open white collar the venetianstyle garment flared from her waist down to the ground held up by hoops dozens of them in addition her black hair was bound on top of her head as an ornament decorated with jewels around her neck she wore an expensivelooking pearl necklace while the breathtakingly beautiful lady was walking towards michel her dress majestically dragged on the ground and the longer he looked at her the more unearthly he began to feel when the italian woman walked past him chatting with two gentlemen and a matron she suddenly gave him a candid look a spell was cast he melted like wax under her unexpected gaze and he felt as if his life was now just beginning good heavens he stammered totally rattled and while he kept staring at her he was shaking like a leaf he suddenly felt very small and more vulnerable than he had ever thought possible after years of only visiting patients he had completely forgotten about love and now the sun was beginning to shine in the crevices of his soul during the heartbeat that their eyes met she was also struck by a love arrow and she blushed as she continued on her way with her companions michels heart was aflame and he determined he absolutely must court this woman the lovestruck admirer jumped up threw some money on the table and ran after the italian woman he followed the little group from a distance and feverishly tried to think of a way to approach her the lady sensed him behind her but did not dare to turn around and look and finally entered an establishment the unsteady physician almost started to panic now what he wondered a serving girl happened to be leaving the same place at the same time he noticed and called out to her miss could you please tell me when that last group of people leaves because i have something to discuss with them the servant looked at his neat appearance and responded as he had hoped you are an acquaintance of the de vaudemonts more or less he twisted the truth she became talkative and told him that the company would be returning to the lot en garonne that coming saturday he had the information he wanted thanked her and returned to saint rémy on cloud nine there he began to make plans to meet the woman of his dreams during lunch a changed housemate sat at the table youre in a good mood father remarked and ive never seen you look so handsome his mother added youre positively beaming michel just smiled sheepishly but didnt say a word about it he kept his heart to himself but reynière had an idea i think i know whats going on she said mischievously and when her son asked for a mirror the next day she was sure he must be in love is it on account of a lady that youre so out of sorts she asked um yes he admitted well id better give you a few tips then you may be learned but when it comes to womens business youre better off listening to me mother had seen through his secret and the diligent physician looked at his mother expectantly like a small child women like it when you pay them compliments she told him is she from around here no shes from italy ah the country where fashion comes from then wed better do something to improve your image and that same day mother bought a trendy suit and fit it on him personally hector and antoine were curious and came to see what was going on with their brother in the living room mother is dressing michel they scratched their heads reynière unpacked the new red jerkin and pulled it on over the buttoned up shirt with ruffles on top of this came a black overfrock i want one of those too hector shouted enthusiastically when he saw the expensive velvet overcoat with long split sleeves a few minutes later father came home from work michel i have some mail for you he reported looking on in wonder i cant use my hands right now dad ill put it in your desk for you jacques offered his wife meanwhile kept pulling on the various pieces of clothing youre slight and this makes you look broader she said fidgeting with the coat ill have to take your word for it her son answered and kept standing as still as a statue soon he started to hop from one foot to the other because his mother was trying to put a pair of knickerbockers with a zipper on him then she put white stockings on his feet and wide slippers made of cowhide i think those shoes are beautiful antoine said they sure are his fancy brother said looking down finally reynière placed a hat with a feather on his head and the result was charming indeed he looked both distinguished and stylish everyone agreed and their lovestruck family member paraded through the living room for them goodness gracious you look like a king said father who came in again shaking his head the next day the physician who had taken a day off happily set off to arles wearing his new outfit once there he loitered around the boarding house he had seen the beautiful lady enter before for about an hour he repeatedly looked into all the windows of the building hoping to catch a glimpse of her but she was nowhere to be seen a hunchback who was advertising bullfights in a most irritating way came and stood right next to him the lover slunk away and sat down at the same terrace where had been two days earlier he had just ordered a drink to calm himself when the beautiful woman suddenly appeared out of nowhere and walked past by herself his disappointment disappeared like snow in the sun and he bravely hurried towards her he had not been mistaken she was so beautiful so elegant and fine irresistible the italian woman got butterflies in her stomach when she saw him trotting towards her and for a moment she didnt know what to do on top of that her face turned scarlet when she saw his modern clothing which was perfect in every detail that must be meant for me she thought feeling nervous and honored at the same time mademoiselle de vaudemont he stammered as a physician i must point out to you that the waist of your dress is too tight this is bad for your circulation how stupid of me he thought i meant to give her a compliment i mean it could harm your beauty but there was no reply the italian woman didnt know what to say i should just express myself freely he decided to be honest you have made a profound impression on me and i had to see you again he said that broke the ice and she smiled at his candor do you practice here in arles she asked still a bit stiff but in flawless french without a trace of an accent um no although yes sometimes but i am from saint rémy and i work there too the unnerved physician introduced himself and invited her to sit down and have a drink with him after which they both walked to the terrace where his drink was still waiting for him it was quite a feat to maneuver her hoop skirt between the tables but finally they were sitting down you look truly fabulous he complimented yolande but how can you get through the day wearing that dazzling but heavy dress i only wear this dress when im parading through town as soon as i get home it is removed and she nervously thanked the waiter for the anise drink bystanders meanwhile were openly staring at the enchanting couple the two were completely oblivious to this public attention however and the physician tried to think of topics of conversation its not possible is it to deal with such a dress alone the matron helps me with it she answered and then there was a pregnant pause michel again searched for words but he couldnt find any and ordered another drink instead ive heard it is quite a heavy load to study for physician yolande commented oh five years of university well that is very clever there are not many who could accomplish that she praised him and slowly but surely something beautiful began to flow between them what brings you to arles it looks like youre journeying through on your way somewhere else michel asked yolande told him that her family owned a castle in the lot and garonne to which they were traveling and that she was from a noble lineage i suppose the castle belongs to your parents he commented she confirmed this and started to warm up talking about her father count ferry vi de vaudemont and her mother queen of naples her parents had nine children including herself the chill had completely left the air and the chemistry between them started to manifest the spark between them was palpable it was true love and time had never flown by so fast they were both over the moon when eventually said goodbye to each other and left the scintillated public behind yolande promised to write him as soon as she arrived in the lot back in saint rémy mother immediately inquired how it went for him it was positive he answered coolly positive is that all you have to say you are beaming my man oh all right he laughed out loud but first ive got to get out of this monkey suit and while he was running up to the attic he shouted out she is going to be my wife a week later he received the first letter from his beloved in which she expressed her desire for him after a few more letters it was evident the fire kept burning and the two were meant for each other in the last letter yolande requested him to come and visit her in the lot soon jacques and reynière were overjoyed that their eldest son had finally found a woman and one from a wealthy noble family no less youve caught a big fish michel i hope youll put us in your will his father the notary teased certified idiot his son replied unusually lightheartedly i guess youll get to live in that beautiful castle his mother supposed thats a bit premature mom first lets see how this visit goes but her intuition told her that her son was about to leave the village for good not long after nostradamus left to go and see his princess he was going to rescue her and in his mind he saw a beautiful drama unfold love really did have a blinding effect the lucky devil realized while making the long trip in the carriage by way of toulouse and on the way he found himself possessed by a longing for yolande that would  he thought  burn eternally in the ariège the carriage passed the historic mount montségur where the last of the kathars were murdered en masse centuries ago and he remembered his old university friend françois rabelais the scenery was now getting a lot greener and he began to see vineyards everywhere picking grapes he fantasized right away just to pick grapes with her would be enough and he looked at the blooming vineyards stretching to the horizon intoxicated by his love for her when dusk began to fall the silhouette of castle puivert loomed in the distance it was the castle that belonged to the de vaudemonts the castle was beautifully situated on top of the hill and orion shone above it seemingly symbolically the coachman had planned the trip well because they arrived at seven oclock and he parked his vehicle in the twilight the keyedup lover got out and looked for a sign of life abruptly the portcullis in the massive entrance tower was raised michel took a deep breath and walked to the opened gate with his luggage while he was looking around he caught a glimpse of his beloved behind an open window nervously he walked through the portcullis and across an enormous courtyard while the gate slammed shut behind him to keep out intruders good evening mr nostradamus count de vaudemont greeted him smoothing out his drooping moustache yolandes father kept his distance and a servant rushed to take the bags of the visitor so you are the young physician my daughter has been so enthusiastically exclaiming about did you have a good trip indeed i did my lord but my body is craving some movement now michel answered and demonstratively started to stretch his limbs yolande arrived elated but was unable to exchange one word with her lover for he was taken to his quarters immediately as ordered by her father tonight during dinner you will have plenty of chance to speak to him he whispered to his daughter it was repugnant to the castle lord to see her following the newcomer like a panting deer such nonsense and the count disappeared into one of the rooms with a disapproving look on his face the guest was taken to a donjon that was twenty meters high youll be staying on the top floor the servant mumbled carrying an oil lamp and slowly ascending the stairs a thousand steps higher the tired traveler was left in a room with a fourposter bed that was guarded by the sculptures of eight musicians after a short nap michel decided to explore his immediate surroundings in the dark he climbed a narrow wooden staircase to the roof terrace where he had a great view of the area the full moon was shining onto the village of puivert which was situated on a tranquil lake some commotion in the courtyard caught his attention several wellgroomed guests were there waiting for dinner michel hurried back to his room to get changed and then joined the group which was just starting to go in in the large fancy room stood a gorgeous dining table with matching chairs the kind of furniture belonging to the avantgarde a servant showed the physician to a place across from yolande but between ferry vi and the queen of naples they would put this serious candidate for their daughter to the test the sweethearts were looking expectantly at each other but were also a bit unsure about the parents verdict yolande was wearing a brilliant turquoise gown and her hair was coiffed in a low chignon this time she sent a restrained smile to her friend who subtly answered the dining table was set for royalty there were glass dishes with golden trim and handpainted replicas of the family coat of arms the linen and cutlery were also decorated with it the emblems were everywhere the staff meanwhile had started serving the entrees in addition to the count and the countess there were five sons four daughters three inlaws several grandchildren and a handful of guests during the rich meal the turtle doves could not take their eyes off each other and they began to flirt youre not the only ones at this table you know a soninlaw said irritated in any case one thing was clear the two were in love you seem to have built up a good reputation in the provence the count remarked while his drooping moustache just missed his soup i do my best to cure the ill the physician said but im glad the last outbreak of the plague has run its course because i have very little control over it were very fortunate to not have experienced that terrible disease here the queen of naples said but did you actually graduate the count suddenly asked i already talked to you about that father yolande defended her beau i will bring you my certificate after dinner my lord michel promised please do i am very interested in seeing it ill be expecting you in my room shortly then i happen to have some excellent cognac there as well im sure you understand that i only want the best for my daughter ferry vi remained suspicious and was not in the least embarrassed to go through a list of questions that should determine if the physician was qualified as a soninlaw the questions were about random topics nostradamus was able to give an impeccable answer to each one and slowly the mistrust began to diminish after the dessert the count had a brief private consultation with his wife outside of the dining hall and then returned it seemed the couple had decided that the prospective new husband was good enough for their daughter after that michel could do no wrong after ferry vi had spent some time with him in his room the lovers finally had a chance to be together and they quietly took a walk outside the gate they seemed to understand each other so well that words were superfluous behind a chestnut tree they furtively kissed and the touch was like magic after a week at the castle michel asked for yolandes hand in marriage and she accepted only too happily her calculated father gave his permission that same day after all the candidate met all of his conditions a dream was coming true and nostradamus felt as though he could take on the entire world the physician who had been freed from his melancholy informed his parents of the coming wedding at puivert but they sent a message that it would not be possible for them to make the long trip due to their geriatric ailments only his brother hector would be able to attend their eldest son requested them to send his personal possessions and promised to come to saint rémy with yolande as soon as possible the auspicious day arrived and countless prominent ladies and gentlemen gathered to make it a splendid occasion and it was a spectacular wedding party when the newlyweds were finally alone they could not get enough of each other it is a like fairytale to be married to you michel swooned while they were lying in his fourposter bed kissing it is a fairytale she replied softly and they continued to melt together with the climax as the grand finale the eight sculptures of the musicians had been turned to face the walls after the celestial wedding night they got down to business right away they decided to settle in agen the guild there was looking for a licensed physician and they had accepted nostradamus for the position the influential town was not far from puivert and so the young couple was able to be independent as well maintain contact with the family the blissfully happy pair went on a house hunt and quickly found a suitable residence situated on the town square which had a beautiful fountain while decorating their new home they enjoyed their freedom the summer days and especially each other one sultry night the lovers scampered to the fountain and danced under the spraying water to their hearts content they sat down on the edge dripping and laughing with glee close your eyes yolande requested and she put something in his mouth a cherry he uttered i have something else for you another fruit yes i am pregnant and they continued to kiss ecstatically aside from his work nostradamus set up a small perfume factory where concentrated oils for medicinal use were manufactured a dozen employees distilled plants and herbs into ethereal oils there and their master would develop a recipe for every ailment in the meantime the married couple was starting to feel comfortably at home in agen in the rue du soleil there was a special book store in which michel decided to nose around one day are you finding what you want the owner called from the back im just browsing im not looking for anything in particular the visitor answered the bookseller who had a long beard walked towards him arent you the new doctor thats right im abigail nice to finally meet another wellread person around here in that regard it is slim pickings in this little town i dont know the people here very well yet michel apologized of course a book is much more expensive than a loaf of bread and almost no one can afford to buy one abigail qualified his comment but if youre ever looking for medical literature i will certainly be able to help you i have good connections with publishers in london who are progressive in that area possibly later when i have more time the busy physician said im afraid i have to go already goodbye and he went on to see his next patient after the doctor had acquired a decent collection of medical works in the course of time their first child was born it was a son victor and while he was still in diapers his mother got pregnant again his father meanwhile had become friends with the bookseller who one day had a mysterious bundle set aside for him nostradamus was pleasantly surprised when he saw the work which had the word kabala written on it in gothic letters of course he had heard of it a long time ago but he had never studied it amazing that he would now completely unexpectedly receive it from abigail how much is it he asked reaching for his wallet this book wont cost you anything abigail answered well thank you very much its not me you should thank but a secret admirer of yours the doctor shrugged his shoulders in surprise and accepted the gift at home victor was fast asleep in his little bed and his father had a chance to recuperate in peace from his long work day yolande poured her husband some jasmine tea and they enjoyed each others company sitting in front of the fire the successful physician looked contentedly at his beautiful wife gave her a kiss and laid his hand on her swollen belly the unborn child was already kicking a bit when hed finished his tea he decided to read his new kabala book and took it down from the shelf the bestowal of mystical knowledge was the subtitle while he made himself comfortable nestling close to his spouse on the carpet he opened the book and found a card in it with a name and address on it julius scaliger 15 avenue de lattre agen this must undoubtedly be his secret admirer yolande do you know someone named julius scaliger scaliger that is a famous fellow townsman who is causing quite a stir as a writer he is highly praised everywhere as a humanist she answered why dont i know that you cant know everything darling but why are you asking he gave me this book look heres his card and he gave it to her why would he do that yolande asked surprised darned if i know wait a minute hes a physician too she suddenly remembered court physician of the bishop of agen that must be the link maybe he knows you from the medical university in montpellier no definitely not he said lets see what kind of book he gave me and he began to read besides the written tradition of the bible there is also the tradition of the kabala this mystical knowledge is based on genesis and is passed on primarily from teacher to student the tree of life is the prescribed model and this form is the key to the mystical reading of the bible we are speaking here of the four worlds which symbolize the different levels of consciousness in the story of creation and this knowledge is deepened with the aid of meditation the kabala was originally a jewish mystical tradition used to reveal secret messages in the bible but is now also used in scholasticism the kabala is practiced in esoteric schools and by individual magicians michel closed the book and painfully had to acknowledge that on the spiritual level he had been at a standstill for years this book was a gift from heaven after changing victor the three of them happily went to bed ill have to pay this scaliger a visit soon said michel while their sons eyes were slowly closing take your time sweetheart scaligers not going anywhere hes been living here for years his wife whispered a few days later the doctor knocked on the door at number fifteen in the avenue de lattre a hefty servant opened the door and claimed that his master was not in but a gaunt little man came walking down the stairs it was the court physician himself oh doctor i have a terribly sore throat julius scaliger joked but his humor went right over nostradamus head ill have a look at it in a minute but allow me first to thank you for the beautiful book you gave me he answered seriously no problem to tell you the truth it was abigails choice and the two gentlemen proceeded to the drawing room which was decorated with many portraits of scientists and philosophers impressive you know them all personally the visitor inquired not all of them but the portrait youre looking at right now is of erasmus with whom i have been arguing by correspondence lately they call him the greatest thinker of europe but i think there are quite a few gaps in his line of reasoning and julius sat down in an easy chair ive heard of him admitted michel but what exactly is the reason you sought contact with me en he sat down in a chair too your name comes up on a regular basis his host explained a physician who doesnt care about the religious authorities is rare i am attracted to recalcitrant scientists and since i also studied medicine it seemed to me a good idea for us to get to know each other i feel honored michel replied while he looked around the interior it is such a coincidence that you moved to agen of all places julius continued especially with that beautiful noble flower who makes my heart skip a beat aha so thats why you sent me a present who knows everything plays a role youre very lucky to have such a beautiful wife indeed i am and who is that michel asked pointing to a portrait that is cardano hmm cardano if im not mistaken he is a mathematician and astrologer but also a fraud scaliger said scornfully in his book subtilitate he speaks of demons but the passage was taken word for word from my writing plagiarism is a nasty business his guest responded and what kind of humanist works have you written many but my most important work is the summary of all of the literature that has been published everywhere far past our borders furthermore i am considered to be one of the great thinkers of this century along with erasmus he boasted of the entire century no less i cant stand false modesty his host declared and michel had to smile at the selfwilled humanist the scientists were well matched and spent some time discussing medical documents by aristotle they hit it off very well and decided to visit each other more often during the next few months the bonds of friendship grew between them and one day julius showed his secret library secret because many books were seen as a threat by the church look michel the revolutionary document by copernicus with the sun as the center of the universe actually mystics and astrologers see the sun as one of the stars his friend commented but i suppose a scientist wants to see proof and what can he do with these kinds of pipe dreams on the contrary dreams can be very useful julius answered why dont you write them down some time youll see that your personal development will benefit from it isabelle was born she shone like the sun and grew rapidly the girl seemed to be the center of the universe and victor was her constant companion the maid who didnt have any children of her own liked to pretend the beautiful baby was hers while the family grew and blossomed something sinister was beginning to happen in the outside world agen had been spared from the plague so far but fate now struck after the first case became known public life immediately came to a grinding halt terrified of being infected with the disease everyone avoided contact with each other as much as possible and rightly so because soon there were more victims the progressive city doctor immediately set up quarantine for various districts of the city where hundreds of dogs and cats already lay rotting notradamus was working overtime rushing from one patient to the next the tough physician gave the authorities orders to bury the bodies of both humans and animals between layers of lime in order to prevent infection he also ordered everyone to burn their garbage so that nothing would be left to feed rats and fleas after this there was a constant smell of smoke and fire in the air he told the plague victims who were still alive to rub a cream made with garlic and aloe on their bodies the doctor kept stressing the importance of hygiene and good food and most of the townspeople supported his method some didnt trust him however and were looking for a scapegoat for the disaster riots began to break out in the town square exactly where the nostradamus family was living the overworked physician heard the noise walked to the window and was amazed to see that a fire stake was being prepared next to the fountain in no time at all a huge crowd had gathered around it and two men were led towards it the agenois were furious and shouting at the top of their lungs michel realized that the townspeople were playing judge and jury things were getting out of hand god almighty theyve got abigail he suddenly called out one of those poor bastards was his friend the book seller he was being called all kinds of names and the doctors anger began to boil over yolande came to stand beside him alarmed you will stay here wont you she said frightened but her husband didnt listen to her and ran into the street seething his common sense told him just in time to keep his head cool and he pushed through the crowd in a somewhat controlled manner those rotten jews are the cause of all this evil burn them some of them yelled full of hatred yolande looked on helplessly please dont argue with them she thought stiff with fear the two jews were tied to the poles and someone tried to ignite the stake stop nostradamus screamed the compelling order silenced the crowd and people moved back to make way for the physician who after all was married to one of the vaudemonts he coldly ordered the last of the instigators to move aside and climbed up on the stake with great determination he wrenched off the ropes that tied the unfortunates to the poles the rescuer focused his attention on his old friend abigail for a moment abigail looked at him filled with faith and a light began to shine in his eyes what is happening to me michel thought and for a minute the intense beauty of those eyes unbalanced him no dont show any vulnerability in front of the wolves and guarding against a possible change in the crowds mood he turned around resolutely and spoke strongly to the people the plague is not cause by the jews if this were true it would first have to be irrefutably proven you have all been whipped into this frenzy by fear and fury go home and return to your senses and dont disturb the public order again the heated crowd turned around deflated and the square emptied out yolande was finally freed of her intense fear when michel was safely back in the house dont you ever do that again she called out still shivering i couldnt very well have left them to that rabble your family needs you alive i am alive he teased which made yolande mockingly attack him with a pillow the plague meanwhile continued to rage and the doctor worked around the clock during those days a few weeks later fate knocked on the nostradamus familys door yolande and victor got sick michel was confronted with it when he came home from work late in the evening as white as a sheet he diagnosed them with the feared disease its the damn plague he swore when he was alone in the kitchen and punched the walls with his fists it was a horrible concurrence the plague fighter defeated at the home front deeply upset he broke the bad news to his wife all my attention was on my patients instead of on you he lamented michel please dont blame yourself and promise me that you will go on living with isabelle i dont know if i can live without you a higher power will come through for you darling she tried to comfort him he washed their wounds as they appeared prepared the best food he could think of and hoped for a miracle up to the last minute but to no avail his flower quickly faded and died in his arms he watched the last glow disappear from her eyes and saw her spirit leave her body the next day victor also left his life and while he was kissing his son goodbye he heard his daughter calling him isabelle had been locked up in her room to keep her safe the devastated physician left his daughter in the care of the servant for a day and brought the remains of his family members to puivert his wife had wanted to be buried in the family grave the de vaudemonts watched in horror as a wagon carrying coffins approached of course they understood what had happened but out of fear they left the gate shut this is killing us the count called through a window but there are others here that i love too i understand can someone help me dig a grave at a safe distance the soninlaw asked no sorry good luck the count heartlessly ended the conversation and closed the shutters bitter and alone the widower buried his wife and child in the family grave which was just outside the gate his wifes family secretly watched from the castle back in agen the doctor took charge of his daughter who forced him to go on with his life the first lie about him began to spread through the city yolande buried by her own father that evening the maid knocked on the door a heavily depressed nostradamus opened it as asked what was the matter doctor i came to warn you the de vaudemonts have set the townspeople against you they are accusing you of purposely letting your wife die so that you can run off with the dowry it is also being rumored that you are a friend of the jews i had to tell you sir because i know you are a good person and she ran away michel bolted the front door walked around the house brooding and then took some precautionary measures upstairs in the bedroom he looked at isabelles carefree little face as she lay sleeping peacefully finally he was able to cry and the wind blowing through the open window brushed his tears then the silence was broken and all hell broke loose enraged townspeople carrying torches and shouting malicious battle cries began to gather in front of the house in great numbers murderer they shouted you deserve the death penalty michel looked with one eye from behind the curtains and saw the crowd lets get him now he heard someone say he knew that this time he would have to leave the locked front door was creaking with the effort of the brutes trying to break it open and then a burning torch was thrown into the house barely missing him quick as a wink nostradamus picked up his daughter who woke up with a start he tied her onto his back and ordered her to be quiet behind her bed he wrenched open a drawer in a bureau grabbed a bag of provisions out of it and threw it over his shoulder then he ran up the attic stairs with isabelle the bedroom curtains were already in flames and a few minutes later the whole house was ablaze the hooligans finally managed to break down the front door and started to search for the evil magician on the main floor but because of the towering flames they didnt dare to go up any higher meanwhile father with his child bound onto his back was climbing onto the roof at the back of the house and jumped onto the next roof out of sight of the rioters in this way he was able to leave the burning house behind him via the adjoining houses fortunately it was a pitchblack night and the insurgents couldnt find him but halfway there that same darkness caused michel to slip and almost fall off the roof laboriously he reached the last house where he climbed down onto a balcony and from there used a vine to get down onto the ground there he is a shifty character having discovered his shadow suddenly called out the rebels who were still screaming and shouting in front of the house also caught sight of him and came in for the chase right away the limber physician jumped onto the ground and ran off he managed to loose his pursuers in the maze of lanes and alleys and fled the city as fast as the wind far away into the hills and forests a short while later they gave a sock belonging to the doctor to a pack of tracker dogs to smell and they quickly found the trail the chase was resumed why are they so angry isabelle asked they dont like us said father who thought they had escaped them but why not were good arent we yes but they have a different opinion and then to his horror he saw a group of hunters in the valley he increased his speed pushing on through the forest up on a hill the plateau suddenly ended and a gaping chasm prevented them from fleeing any further while he paced back and forth on the edge of the cliff he frantically searched for a solution the sound of the barking dogs was getting louder he had to think of something quick okay ill have to go down that impossibly steep cliff he decided michel placed his hands on the edge and swung his legs over he felt around with his feet for a place to put them while his hands were threatening to start slipping they found something and using the utmost concentration he began the impossible descent isabelle was terrified looking down into the ravine from his back their pursuers were making rapid progress and soon reached the same chasm they discovered nostradamus who was covering the last part of the sheer cliff twenty meters below them and then disappeared into the shelter of the trees and bushes the moon disappeared behind the clouds and they could no longer follow him with their eyes the conspirators didnt dare to try to go down the same way especially because it could not be done with their dogs some of the pursuers who knew the area like the back of their hands pointed to some nearby passages the group split up and carried on with the chase miles ahead michel had to choose between two paths one going up and one going down because of the tall trees he couldnt really get a good impression of where either path led and he took a gamble and chose the path going down following the chosen route he soon arrived at a passable fissure which separated two plateaus from each other a group of pursuers who had taken another route had now found the same trail the dogs could once again be heard michels strength was beginning to diminish he had traversed an enormous distance and would not be able to keep this up much longer the moon came back and lit up an opening in the rocks that was within reach almost feeling the townspeoples hot breath on his neck the doctor decided to hide in the cave who knows with a bit of luck but the pariah was discovered again there they go someone called out underneath the stone vault michel frantically searched in his shoulder bag he took out a candle and quick as a flash lit it with a firestone light was indispensable here and carrying his valuable load on his back he strode through the cave which led to an underground network of paths damn the flame is going out he swore walking too fast he lit the candle again and continued on his way he suddenly heard screaming behind him good heavens theyre here already were sure not having any luck at all he murmured to himself the enemy entered the cave and the dogs barking now became frighteningly altered this disoriented the beasts and made it harder for them to keep following the trail the attackers however were not discouraged by this and immediately split into smaller groups after all there were only a limited number of passages one of them knew divided into various groups they continued on their way nostradamus heard them come closer and tried to make as little sound as possible at one point he saw a tunnel with shallow groundwater this would be his one chance to get rid of those dogs they would completely lose the scent here father felt around to make sure his daughter was still firmly tied to his back and then began to wade through the tunnel although she was only two years old she understood the seriousness of the situation and was keeping as quiet as a mouse the water level began to rise at an alarming rate however and father was beginning to fear the worst while the townspeople were right at their heels he desperately went on the water was now reaching to his waist and his daughter was shivering with cold its over he lamented just another few moments and i will have to take isabelle off my back the water was already up to her lips maybe i should surrender he considered maybe they would let my little girl live but who would raise her no one would want the child of magician whose family died of the plague especially after those accusations by my inlaws and despondently he kept wading suddenly the ground disappeared from under his feet and he was forced to start swimming michel said a quick prayer while the candle extinguished and sunk to the bottom may the lord be with us are those bastards never going to give up and he swam towards a treacherous black hole and then hit his head on the ceiling but wonder of wonders they were both still breathing and the walls were slowly beginning to recede there was more room to move and with big strokes he swam on in the underground lake no one is following us he noticed then he felt ground under his feet and with some difficulty he slipped and slid up the slippery slope i believe we are going to make it isabelle he whispered feeling hopeful again and thoroughly drenched they reached the bank where he listened for sounds for a long time it seemed that the villains had really given up the chase because there was still no sound to be heard after resting for a little while he took a new candle out of his bag and the damp wick soon took flame a gigantic cave with innumerable holes and tunnels lit up and michel hurried to find his way the limestone layer down here had been worn by precipitation for centuries and turned into a labyrinth this cave could be millions of years old he contemplated and promptly discovered walls covered in mythical drawings of live animals were not the first ones here isabelle and he looked around in wonder running horses and taut deer drawn in black red and yellow seemed to be ready to leap off the glistening walls the mysterious images were full of action and movement just past a round vault a purplecolored foal with black manes looked you right in the eye and a white cow was jumping playfully across the ceiling a little further in a gallery of jumping and falling figures a pregnant mare who was hit by an arrow was shown it somehow reminded him of yolande and he quickly turned his head prehistoric drawings he mumbled he was at the end of his rope and he looked for a place to spend the night achoo isabelle unexpectedly sneezed and the sound echoed through the cave i hope no one heard that father thought feeling afraid again he took his daughter down from his back and laid her down in a hollow in the ground our clothes will just have to dry on us he concluded after feeling his jacket he blew out the candle after which they both fell into an exhausted sleep michel soon woke up to find some stones painfully pressing into his ribs isabelle was still asleep too bad it was not a nightmare he sighed he felt around for the last candle and lit it he saw water dripping down a rockface and caught it in a cup his little girl woke up a few minutes later and he gave her some water to drink there was some bread and dried meat in the bag and they used this to still their hunger for the time being their clothes were a bit dryer and it was time to start looking for an exit he tied his child onto his back again and began to search for the light after an hour they had still not found an opening and the last candle was getting frightfully small they just kept on wandering around when suddenly the flame started to pull to one side in hopeful expectation he waked toward the breath of wind and soon discovered a ray of light shining through a hole in the ceiling he could see the blue of the sky it was a sight for sore eyes after that prolonged darkness but theres nothing for me to pull myself up on he thought discouraged while he examined the steep walls wait a minute and he took a knife out of his bag thinking he could carve out hand and footholds the limestone was brittle enough and it worked well when the job was done he carefully pulled himself up to on the carved out crevices with isabelle on his back after a superhuman effort he reached the opening and sticking to the wall he put his hand outside for a minute the sun shone on it the star that makes everything visible he thought humbled and after enlarging the opening he crawled out and found himself on a grassy plain where he immediately scouted out the area like an eagle there was no human in sight and he breathed a great sigh of relief isabelle we made it its all behind us now and he took his daughter down from his back the girl was finally standing on her own two feet again and ran around through the landscape where there was no house anywhere to be seen weve got to get ourselves cleaned up little one said father who suspected there might be a river or stream up in the hills further on he put isabelle up on his shoulders and after a short walk they reached a valley with a small brook running through it the river water looked clean and they took a drink from it then they took off their shoes and dangled their feet in the clear water after they had washed their faces michel gave his daughter a piece of bread from the bag which also held a small fortune over three hundred francs the de vaudemont dowry that should get us through the next few years he estimated and he began to think of a strategy for the future going back to agen was not an option first leave the area on foot and then hopefully find a carriage to take us to saint rémy that seemed like a good plan a little further on grew some plum trees and the ripe fruits were easy to pick after eating their fill they started to recuperate a bit from the exhausting witch hunt isabelle already cried out in glee at a butterfly that fluttered by truly life goes on father observed wistfully perhaps she really will make my life worth living that day they traveled over hills and dales and by sunset they discovered a small dilapidated stone house that lay hidden in a woodsy area the hovel proved to be deserted and they chose a spot in its shelter here they could safely spend the night charcoal remains on the floor told of fires that had been lit there probably by hunters after eating some dried meat and a few more plums it was time to go to sleep father curled around his daughter to protect her from the wind which freely blew through the ruin in the middle of the night the wind became more intense and howled through the little wreck of a house it woke nostradamus up and he checked to make sure his little girl was still beside him before he went back to sleep it was late the next morning when a magpie woke him up by loudly singing on the roof his daughter however had not made a peep yet isabelle he whispered and he touched her why is she so quiet and he bent over her with a dreadful premonition god no he shouted as he recognized the black spots on the childs face with great horror his screaming woke up isabelle and she opened her eyes and indicated that she was not feeling well this confrontation with the plague was too much for him something inside him snapped and in a daze he sat and held his daughter gently rocking her the next day she died and with her died his motivation to stay alive he just sat there staring off into space as a haunting scene began to play in his mind you can leave those two together one cant survive without the other the french officer ordered the inseparable duo bruno and yves was dragging the heavy cannon on its mount to the front through the mud with great effort the abundant rain had changed the dusty ground into a brown muck and their blue uniforms were getting covered in it while they worked pull to the left you blockhead bruno reproached his companion i thought youd take care of the job with the powers of your mind yves sighed they finally got the cannon in the right spot and bruno started to tamp down the gunpowder while yves placed the cannon ball into the top of the barrel the trick was to get the missile to backfire on the ground right in front of the enemy so that it could then penetrate the lines at mans height the whole artillery was brought into position and general ney stood ready to give the signal for attack fire he commanded the french cannons thundered and the alliance brigade suffered visible losses the artillerists then watched the battle of waterloo1815 progress while four of their divisions marched to the mont saint jean two enemy brigades cavalry unexpectedly rode into the marching french soldiers who had to beat a hasty retreat it was now all hands on deck and the cannons were reloaded as quickly as possible hurry up yves throw that ball in the entire supply of ammunition was used up in no time but the english were beat to a pulp when trumpets heralded the attack the french riders galloped through the slush to deal the alliance the deathblow but suddenly completely unanticipated thousands of prussians shot out of the forest to help the others and they completely trampled those roosters to save their lives bruno and yves crawled underneath the cannon and in the midst of the chaos aimed their guns i wish we were still in the provence yves said dreamily while some of their officers kicked the bucket right in front of their eyes with their sables in their hands bruno didnt get a chance to respond because he was hit by an enemy cannon ball at the same time his arms and legs were flung through the air and only his head stayed beside his buddy with a start nostradamus jumped back into reality after all those horrific dream images he saw the partly decomposed body of this daughter lying beside him surrounded by a swarm of flies get out he yelled like a madman and swung his arms to disperse them the father had grown wild he didnt know how long hed been sitting there he rose and picked up the remains of this child and buried them in the open field rest in peace my little girl he said calming down a bit you were only given a short life now i must take my leave and say farewell to you life goes on after he had placed a cross made of branches on the little grave he picked up his bag and began to walk after hed taken a few steps he turned around and looked at it one last time from then on the cast away physician wandered late one night there was an unexpected loud banging on the front door of an inn somewhere high in the pyrenees the owner reluctantly opened it and was startled by the scarylooking person on his front step the sinister visitor was wearing a dirty black cape with a hood and had a wild beard he had an evil look and his face looked like tanned leather um sorry were closed the innkeeper said frightened then why is the door open the stranger objected then he gave him a franc and obstinately walked in i want to stay here for a few days the traveler continued it seemed pointless to argue with him i guess we do have a room the landlord stammered but may i ask you what your name is you may call me discute he answered and the owner showed him to his room i would like something to eat and drink before i go to sleep his guest let him know and again pressed a franc into his hand he sure is generous with his money the host thought greedily and he quickly put a jug of beer in front of him before he hurried to the kitchen to prepare a meal after a little while he served the weird fellow some hot mush the illatease innkeeper wanted to go to bed but thought hed better stay alert for the time being mister discute did you see the beautiful sky even in these mountains it is rare to see so many stars in the heavens no i didnt notice his guest answered and stoically continued to eat you can even see the planet mars the owner continued with the naked eye yes of course what else a spy glass the stranger declared who wiped his mouth and then drank his beer in one gulp ive never heard of that the owner stammered i once had one his guest claimed who had finished his plate and was now getting ready to go to sleep well goodnight then and please forgive me for denying you entrance before the inn keeper said finally feeling it was safe to leave him the visitor entered his room and hung his cape on a hook then he walked over to the closed window with a heavy gait opened the shutters and looked out at the unusually clear sky mars was indeed visible with the naked eye people come and people go but stars and planets always remain he thought while he looked at the sparkling spica it was long ago grandpa when we used to look at the sky together michel took his wallet out of its holder put it safely under his pillow and lay down in the musty bed tomorrow i will walk through the mountains a bit he thought then he stared out the window a little while later the waxing moon came into view and the wandering physician looked at the planet of maternal feeling and uncertainty the moon kept getting bigger and seemed to want to be the center of attention michel slowly fell into a trance imperceptibly it had become white everywhere around him and where ever he looked was the moon he suddenly realized he was no longer lying in his bed but floating in space he turned around and looked for the familiar earth but it was far away he started to panic because of the enormous empty space around him after which he returned to his bed with a bang covered in cold sweat he realized that he had had an outofbody experience a very unpleasant one i think ill hang around on earth for a while after all he thought when the next morning he was walking outside in the rarefied air he discovered to his great surprise that the blinders had fallen from his eyes the whole world was suddenly open and naked and the previously thin mountain air was pregnant with a myriad of ideas which formed the material world the ideas were born out of stagnant material and in both atmospheres time had become a threedimensional phenomenon it was a wondrous reciprocal creation innumerable causes and effects were also revealed to him and due to the many impulses he weaved about like a drunk on the mountain path it seemed as if his causal body had become functional before the moon has finished waxing your slumbering knowledge will awaken but first the black death will lead you to repentance he now remembered the words of hermes but that means that my family has been sacrificed for me it occurred to him is that what they mean by the naked truth truth that is not bearable for a human and he cringed in pain with the ghastly realization does god have no mercy he moaned and if my family was just a pawn in this game then what am i then we are all just marionettes in a play they were cutting insights and for a minute he felt an enormous resentment towards the almighty creator but who am i to hate him he quickly reconsidered i am but an insignificant link in the chain and he let go of his hatred i will play my role and let the chaff be sifted from my wheat he decided and with determination the reborn seer climbed to the mountain top the brief streams of information which continually changed their nature were overwhelming for his sixth sense and he couldnt get a grip on it yet he let it run its course and turned around on a jutting cliff to view the beautiful landscape which stretched north of the city of pau but again he caught a shred of information pau nay loron more fire than blood pampon and durance keep the greatness imprisoned the riddle was unfortunately interrupted by new symbols and images which made him reel im going to have to learn to walk again he determined with surprise the next day nostradamus left the pyrenees and traveled to the city of pau to inquire about the names of pampon and durance at the town hall a local government official received him in his office and the shaggy physician showed him his doctors title to be on the safe side im sorry but i cant help you with your search the officer said maybe the mayor has heard of these names take a seat over there for a moment michel sat down in the reception room where someone was making a statue out of clay he followed the creative process from a distance but soon padded over to the artist for a chat whats it going to be he asked the holy virgin mary the man answered without passion and what will it be cast in bronze michel sat down on the waiting bench again and after a while started to feel annoyed about the dutiful execution of the virgin mary statue he finally got up restlessly and again walked towards it at this rate it will look more like a devil than the holy virgin mary he nagged the workman was very insulted i will have to report your comment he barked but his squabbling left michel cold the mayor finally showed up and invited the unknown scholar into his office pampon and durance he said thinking hard the latter is the same as the river but i will have to look in our archives come back next week and i will probably have more information for you that week the outsider was suddenly grabbed by the collar in the town hall because the authorities were charging him with blasphemy notradamus had to appear in court in the court room he admitted that he had made the critical comment to the workman but he defended himself with the fact that he was only commenting on the ignorance of the artist not about the virgin mary herself do you have a witness the judge asked unfortunately i dont then your argument is not convincing i hereby sentence you to one week in the nay jail and i am being lenient michel was led away in handcuffs as it turned out the house of detention in nay was under renovation and the convicted man was therefore transferred to the jail in loron ive never locked up a scientist in here before the warden said youd better give me some water and bread before i escape michel responded dryly the warden laughed in three days pampon will be here to relieve me i will miss your humor humor is not my strongest side but may i ask you what your name is durance after his release the rejected scholar found himself sauntering along a forest trail somewhere in the charente thinking about the symbolism of all the messages he had been getting from above what if i combine the information with astrology he thought then i should be able to accurately predict the date of the predictions within one or two days and he was just about to bend down to pull up his baggy pants when a beech tree told him that one of its kind was about to fall down on his guard he carefully took one step at a time when a chestnut tree smashed down on the path right in front of him are you trying to inspire me the oddball foolishly asked after stepping over the obstacle he pondered the prediction that had come true argued with himself about its purity and compared it to previous cases shortterm prophesies are showing courser energies he discovered but in order to penetrate the symbolism i need more knowledge about the subject too bad i didnt record the lucid dreams in my youth from now on he would record all predictions in a journal and occasionally make connections after wandering for some time he heard from a traveling trader that the monastery in the coastal town of fécamp in normandy had a nice guest house the monks there were very compassionate it sounded like a good place to retreat for a while he decided to follow these recommendations and joined the monastery which was situated at the bottom of the chalk cliffs the order of the benedictines reigned here and they followed the rules of their spiritual leader from the fourth century after christ nostradamus demonstratively threw his duffle bag on the ground and brother mabillon walked up to him and asked him how he could be of service i would like to stay here for a while the visitor indicated while a flock of monks in black robes very slowly walked past behind him that is fine we do expect our guests to strictly follow the rules in other words to sleep eat and work with us thats perfect for me because i am in dire need of some regularity michel answered airily dont think it will be easy the monk commented everyone is expected to work hard from seven in the morning till seventhirty at night after that everyone still has to attend a lecture and a short prayer is said on every even hour all of this is seven days a week oh yes and breakfast is at six oclock excellent there are some portions of the day where you can choose your own activity the monk continued benoit mabillon then assigned a room to him after which they all sang the twelve oclock mass late in the evening there was a recreational hour and michel got to see the other side of mabillon benoit showed himself to be a fun monk with rebellious tendencies our leader benedictus shunned worldly riches and temptations he chatted we do too of course but you really ought to taste my herbal brew it has a good amount of alcohol added to it i cant wait when they arrived in his quarters a few minutes later the jolly benedictine poured him some of the homemade drink this is great his guest said after downing it thats what i think i have incorporated twentyseven rare plants and herbs from all over the world into it benoit said proudly it is a rich infusion id love to learn from you i could probably use your knowledge of herbs later for combating diseases no problem tomorrow after the vespers you can come and take a look in my kitchen we pray for the whole world not just for ourselves in the same way our knowledge should be shared gradually benoit taught his friend to recognize and process herbs and michel helped him to decipher old writing styles look here is a text about astrology your territory benoit said when they were looking through a collection of books together the connection with the warmhearted monk had come just at the right time after a miserable period in his life the physician began to heal somewhat he decided he would stay and adhere to the strict rules of the monastery until the end of the winter during a free hour one afternoon michel was sitting high up on the cliffs staring out at the horizon of the atlantic ocean the british coast was not far the fascinating city of london must be somewhere over there he knew but you could see nothing but waves which drifted steadily towards the straits of dover shrieking seagulls caught his attention they were following fishing boats that had pulled up their nets suddenly a prediction came to the observer from england a sad event would come to pass on the island but what he didnt know yet in a document borrowed from benoit he checked the astrological tables for it the current position of the stars and planets will not repeat itself until 1666 he calculated while the wind ruffled the pages holding his pen in his hand he again reflected on the coming disaster which was still unclear i will have to buy the right measuring tools because the time calculations are very broad this way next he wrote down the concepts and put the calculations next to them in code if this falls into the hands of those accursed religion judges without any disguise ill be in big trouble ive already learned that lesson that night he went to bed feeling content well before the start of lauds he was rudely awakened from his sleep at least thats what he thought fire someone screamed and thick clouds of smoke floated through his room michel was so startled he fell out of bed and took off running down the stairs the ground floor was going up in flames and it looked impossible to extinguish the fire isabelle where are you he called confused but then it slowly dawned on him that his daughter was no longer alive on the ground floor a cracked stone oven was visible through the dense smoke it was whitehot there were also broken bags of flour everywhere this is not a monastery but a bakery he realized i am dreaming big flames suddenly moved his way and interrupted his train of thought while he ran away he saw through his automatic behavior and wondered if the dream body would be able to get burned he bravely turned back and put his hand in the fire ouch he screamed in pain and fled outside i still think this is a dream though he maintained the enormous sea of flames was spreading to the other buildings and nostradamus watched from a safe distance he was curious to find out what city he had ended up in across from the bakery was an imposing bridge which he thought he recognized from pictures it was the tower bridge in london dont just stand there come on help us an englishman suddenly called out i have no trouble understanding him michel thought surprised i suspect that in dreams the language of the heart is what is spoken but the french observer had no notion to help he was a time traveler not a londoner the fire was spreading rapidly through the packed wooden houses on the waterfront where lightly flammable things were stored fire fighters were rushing onto the scene by now but the earlier destruction of the waterwheel next to the famous bridge had cut off the water supply the fire could not be conquered the neverceasing wind blew the fire deeper into the city and the riverbank along with the many districts along it was getting completely devoured the dreamer wandered behind the sea of flames following it to the city center where the rich neighborhoods were threatened fire fighters began to demolish adjoining houses  due to lack of water   in an attempt to contain the fire finally more than half of the city had gone up in flames and the magnificent cathedral of saint paul came down then the wind died down and the biggest fire in human memory slowly went out the old center of london had gone up in smoke1666 the great fire of london one year later in strasbourg it was raining cats and dogs and nostradamus who was still roaming around entered an establishment where people were playing folk songs workmen were waving beer pitchers to the music and singing at the top of their lungs drunk crazy and foolish i bit into my beer i drank a pint with rené i drank a barrel with renaud the gloomy widower could not suppress a smile upon seeing so many cheerful though tipsy faces the musicians were playing various instruments there was a portative organ a flute and a sackbut the next battle song had a tambourine in it lets have another drink someone blustered michel sat down at a table with people who were heartily indulging in the beverages and for the sake of solidarity he ordered a large pint a new song was announced the thirsty sounds after an hour or so the mood of the music changed a viol gradually transported the audience to rapture and the sounds became sultry then some women of easy virtue showed up and began to seduce the male guests the men leered at them but michel though sitting with them was as cool calm and collected as they were excited this barely interested him at the other side of the bar he saw a distinguished gentleman whom he thought he recognized the grayhaired old man wearing a beret was having a discussion with his companion a young nobleman unfortunately their faces were not clearly visible in the sparse light and curious he decided to have a closer look when he got closer he was still not sure who it was until the old man suddenly looked at him then he knew do you want something the man asked combed curls peeped out from under his beret i think you are erasmus michel answered the dutch scholar was pleasantly surprised nice to be recognized and who are you i am doctor nostradamus thats funny he thought at the same time the great thinker has a squeaky little voice erasmus looked at him thoughtfully but he did not recognize the name this is the marquis de florenville he introduced his companion have a seat the marquis said michel thanked him and sat down aha now i remember erasmus cried out i think i heard about you during one of my trips to italy arent you that doctor who saved the popes life by advising him to lock himself up in his house during an outbreak of the plague yes thats me and i had the opportunity to admire your portrait at the house of julius scaliger oh scaliger erasmus sighed i still have to answer his letter the conversation between the two scholars was just getting started when two ladies of pleasure came to their table they noticed the surly nostradamus and tried to seduce him the loose women impudently sat down on his lap and stroked his beard the people around them gaped at the conspicuous encounter michels table mates were also curious to see how he would react apparently you are attractive de florenville joked but the former plague fighter stiffly stared straight ahead the women were now kissing his forehead and provocatively pushing their breasts in his face only the viol could still be heard and everyone was sitting at the edge of their chair the practiced ascetic however had no intention of giving in to any lustful demands and whispered something in their ears after that they ran away screaming everyone was speechless and a painful silence ensued in the previously festive place the owner knew what to do though he ordered the musicians to let loose and the party atmosphere was soon back in full swing what on earth did you whisper to those ladies erasmus and de florenville asked very curiously that they will die of a professional disease within a week their table companion answered dryly erasmus burst out laughing nothing is as piquant as to treat silly things with such a serious expression on your face that no one notices it is just a joke it was not a joke michel explained the marquis was shocked to hear that and considered the remark very offcolor you really cant do that as a physician what you just said was not a diagnosis but a curse it was not a curse but a prediction that will come true i only speak the truth the seer replied indeed the christian doctrine forbids those kinds of practices de florenville sneered then id like to point out the following passages from the bible to you mister the marquis in joel it says that god believes that people receive the gift of prophesy and visions in amos it is stated that god shows his decisions to the prophets in deuteronomium it is written that god condemns all forms of occult practices with the exception of astrology in the letter to the hebrews it says that everything is naked and open would you like me to continue mister the marquis the conceited ass shut up ive been having visions since my youth i also studied astrology michel emphasized the marquis was hoping for some criticism from his learned friend erasmus after such boasting but he was unmoved i cant say anything about that he told them i dont have the ability to predict the future and i can only speak about my own experiences de florenville stared ahead with a sour look on his face finally someone with an open mind the physician mumbled women have a soft spot for the religious order erasmus said because they can find a sympathetic ear among civilized people and can pour out their hearts about their husbands well im not going to curry any favor with women michel denounced all that gossiping the ladies misjudged you you are the exception to the rule but not the worst kind where did those ladies go anyway erasmus asked the departed ladies were back and having their fun but they did not come close to the cursed table anymore ignorance is bliss the humanist continued a simple remark is all it takes to make them happy again and they share their fortune with many the conversation changed to another topic the thinker from rotterdam turned out to be seventy years old an unheard of old age the average lifespan was around thirtyfive he also told the physician that he was on his way to bazel so youre only in strasbourg to take a break michel supposed partly i am going to be honored here tomorrow at city hall for my entire humanistic body of work also i know mister de florenville from the circle of the humanistic scholar jacob wimpfeling with whom i have had the pleasure to engage in many discussions strasbourg has become an important center of the literary arts because of wimpfeling de florenville who was coming out of his funk informed him certainly and that is how we met erasmus agreed weve kept in touch ever since and mister de florenville is my willing host whenever i visit this city the three table mates conversed until late in the evening finally the owner told his guests that it would soon be closing time and the three men had a last drink of beer once outside they said goodbye under a dry sky the ancient dutchman indicated that he would like to see the clairvoyant physician again some time there is little chance of that michel said he foresaw that erasmus would die that summer the old humanist got the hint and was faced with his mortality after which they gave each other a warm handshake surprisingly de florenville invited his new acquaintance to stay at his castle for a while nostradamus had no responsibilities of any kind and accepted the invitation after all he was on this earth to experience life a week later the seer traveling in a distinguishedlooking carriage was on his way to the château de florenville in the lorraine a region near strasbourg it took the coachman a while to find it the castle lay hidden in a remote dark forest at the entrance to the vast estate was a gatehouse where he announced his arrival the gatekeeper opened the tall gate without any questions and let the carriage with the expected scholar through to the forecourt a few minutes later the castle became visible through the trees it was situated on an island that was surrounded by a moat the carriage went across a drawbridge and came to a halt in front of the steps leading up to the castle de florenville came out right away doctor notradamus how nice youre here he feigned it was obviously still bothering the marquis that he had been humiliated by him in front of erasmus shall we take a stroll through the castle garden first he suggested his guest felt ready to stretch his legs and agreed de florenville meanwhile pretended everything was aokay and took him to a maze that was made out of beech hedges your place is magnificent michel said while the marquis thanked him a nasty little idea struck him and his mind floated along with the wind ill have some fun with that supposed clairvoyance of his he thought cunningly i will expose him in the presence of all my guests the men walked through the labyrinth where a small statue of marco polo was set up in the center and functioned as the end point at the same time after that they proceeded through a turnstile into the orchard where several types of fruit trees grew de florenville then showed him the vegetable garden with all kinds of exotic plants there were some sheds next to it with pigs in one of them a black one and a white one doctor nostradamus the host suddenly spoke up selfimportantly you claim to be clairvoyant can you predict for me which one of these two pigs will be served for dinner tonight you have my word that i will not say anything about this to my cook it smelled like deceit but michel answered without hesitation we will have the black swine for dinner tonight because a wolf will devour the white one back at the castle de florenville made a beeline for the kitchen an immediately broke his word he ordered the cook to slaughter the white swine for dinner the cook slaughtered the chosen pig and put it on a spit while he was busy in the kitchen he called his galley boy grenouille would you get some herbs from the garden for me and receiving no answer started looking for him but grenouille was nowhere to be found and so the cook went out to pick the herbs himself right at that moment an observant wolf happened by snuck in through the open kitchen door grabbed the white pig and made off with it when the cook returned and saw what had happened he was very upset and decided not to tell his master he just went and got the black pig slaughtered it and managed to prepare it just in time meanwhile the prominent guests were chatting with each other in the drawing room have you read any of wimpfelings works yet a nobleman asked no i have been occupied primarily with scientific dissertations michel answered well i highly recommend him thank you i will take your advice to heart he responded politely the marquis welcomed his guests and invited them to take their places at the table during the first few courses all manner of subjects were discussed until the lord of the castle asked for everyones attention right before the main course in order to reach the required profundity on this beautiful evening i would like to quote my friend erasmus true happiness exists only in illusions we create about it although i greatly esteem his motto i would like to add an amusing sideline to it tonight let us leave dreaming to the fools because momentarily a delicious dish will be served which will make our mouths water it will approach true happiness speaking of dreams i would like to draw your attention to the fact that we have a prophet here in our midst tonight the guests all looked at each other in surprise wondering who he was talking about michel was sitting at ease he knew right away what de florenville was up to trying to make a fool of him it is mister nostradamus the host revealed the noblemen were all on edge noticing his critical tone of voice and regarded the physician dubiously and this afternoon my guest made a prediction about our main course now i personally dont believe in such hoopla but we shall see if he was right again the key question mister nostradamus will a white or a black swine be served for our dinner tonight it will be the black one he stood his ground the marquis then gave the cook the sign to put the covered dish on the table and at the critical moment he lifted off the lid to his dismay he saw that it was the black pig is this not a blackbaked white swine he asked despairingly but the honest cook confessed his mistake and told him that this was indeed the black swine because the white one was taken by a wolf the party then heartily laughed at the marquis who had ended up playing a trick on himself he did not look at his intangible guest who received praise from everyone for the rest of the evening the popular physician had no problem relaxing on the estate for several weeks enjoying the opulence until his host could stand it no longer and ordered him to leave the next day the scholar left the castle in the air behind without any regrets after all that luxury and extravagance it was time for some purification and nostradamus decided to visit the mountains he went to the alps to appreciate their pure mountain air the majestic nature of the swiss confederation was quite an experience and he found his heart expanding more and more his insights also increased the growth was painful and difficult at the same time because suffering and enjoyment are so close together why is it that people have to suffer before they can enjoy michel asked out loud while he was crossing a quiet mountain lake by himself but the lake stayed veiled in silence while he steadily paddled along on the barge oh well i think i know we have frittered away out talents in our youth and now we have to fight to reconquer that quality he convinced himself mountain gods tell me why is a baby still one with everything only to be kicked out of paradise afterwards but the mountains would not give up their secret and he only had his ego to explain the mysteries of life he felt somewhat jealous of the plants and animals who can better serve the creator by simply being who they are but he comforted himself with the thought that quality is only a quality if it is selfcreated and he longed ardently to observe the naked truth by the strength of his own power some day little by little he began to enjoy life again and with each ascent of a mountain he sang its praises his reward on every mountain top was a clear mind and a beautiful panorama at one point he crossed the rhone at wallis now i know where im being led he put his spiritual search into perspective to italy and in pleasant solitude he continued his journey to the land of the mighty church weeks later in the vicinity of perugia he ran into a group of monks in a mountain pass he could tell by their impoverished appearance that they were franciscans the monks wearing grey robes were followers of the holy francis of assisi who preached poverty as a means to get closer to god as they approached each other the frenchman stepped aside to let them pass and respectfully bowed his head out of the corner of his eye he caught a glimpse of one of the franciscans and spontaneously uttered a cry of admiration he knelt and brought his head down on the feet of the surprised monk michel was taken aback by his own devotion and understood that he had met his superior come on im nothing special the young monk responded but the seer could see it crystalclearly in front of him and said i can only bow down to your holiness you were once a poor swineherd you are now a simple monk but some day your name will shine in gold letters on the highest place of the saint peters dome in rome you are the future pope sixtus v the surprised monk looked at his brothers inquiringly but they didnt know what to think of it either many roads lead to rome my dear friend and may the lord be with us all he said and the franciscans continued on their way after his long selfcastigation the traveler sought refuge in the opulent city of venice because a change of scenery could do no harm the city had passed its golden age and kept losing more and more conquered ground nevertheless he was curious to see the greatest harbor of the western world it was the city where the renowned marco polo and columbus had grown up the latter had just discovered america a small fishing boat brought michel to a gigantic harbor where dozens of ships were mooring or anchored some of the exotic loads of silks spices and strange jewelry had been en route for years he jumped ashore with his luggage and walked past bags and crates with chinese and arabic lettering which were piled high there seems to be quite a bit of action around here he chuckled to himself venice was shrouded in a thick layer of fog and the numerous palaces churches and canals were scarcely visible michel soon found some moderate lodgings and stored his belongings there he decided to take a tour through the city and climbed down the worn steps of the rooming house sir you forgot your key the landlord called after him i dont need a key the scholar replied in good italian for i have trust but can you tell me how i can get a gondola the italian suggested that his nephew would probably like to give him a tour a little while later michel was in a gondola touring the many canals that were connected by as many bridges passing through the nephew asked yes and no i think i may stay a while the frenchman answered then you must be very privileged there are not many people who have time money and independence youre right but decadence is a distant prospect when they were going under the bridge of sighs the gondolier began to complain my dreams are still not coming true last night i had another nightmare but his customer didnt feel like listening to his moaning and directed his attention to the busy water traffic this is the main canal the canal grande his guide told him returning to his task at hand and over there is the rialto bridge after some time michel had seen the most beautiful places and he asked to be let off at the ducal palace soon there will be a carnival perhaps youd like to go the gondolier suggested at the conclusion no that will be of no interest to me the tightlipped foreigner responded as he put a coin in the bag and then disappeared behind the palace from which the doges ruled the city there was music in the streets and nostradamus decided to leave his books alone i think ill indulge in a diversion he thought and left his upstairs rooms to observe the festival from closeby crowds of venetians were proceeding among the hubbub outside and had decorated themselves festively their faces were covered with elegant masks which depicted different characters mainly a parody of the universal scholar the posh merchant the harlequin and the provocative maid and tomorrow theyll be complaining about nightmares because this certainly doesnt do anything to clear the mind the seer grumbled on the plaza of san marco the dreamlike spectacle was in full swing it was packed full of merrymakers and the music filled the grand square to get away from the jostling michel shuffled along the waterfront and after avoiding a tall pillar with a lion he arrived at the somewhat quieter piazetta where he saw an unusual lady she was wearing a star of david around her neck and was surrounded by little children who were playing around a butterfly made of colored glass it was the gnostic butterfly interested he walked towards here what a beautiful butterfly he called out but it was too noisy to make himself heard the woman saw him approach and without saying anything handed him a mask of the devil the gesture probably meant that he should fit in with the partying folks and he willingly put the mask on just when he wanted to ask her if she thought it looked good on him the intriguing woman and all the children had disappeared as if by magic he looked in all directions but the many party goers were blocking his view he was surprised to discover her once more next to an ageold library and she beckoned him to come closer speechless he pushed through the crowd but when he got to the library she was gone again and he felt embarrassed he saw her again with the children they were dancing through the gate of paper and he elbowed his way to the central building but when he arrived at the inner courtyard all he saw were the statues of mars and neptune he hastily looked around everywhere there she was running up the stairs of the giants she was obviously playing a game with him is this some kind of carnival ritual he called after her but the sound was drowned by the noise all around them he decided to follow the mystery was lured into alleys and found himself in a quieter district the mysterious lady was now dancing with her kids on a wooden staircase and disappeared into one of the old houses which were casting long shadows because of the setting sun he came to an overgrown courtyard with a water well but there was no sign of the woman or the children anybody there he asked but there was no response behind the courtyard he noticed a door he opened it and entered a narrow lane that led to another courtyard that had several doors where am i being led to he wondered on the first entrance the word shalom was written and he opened the door in the room stood a table with a sevenarmed candleholder placed in the center he well remembered the menorah from his youth hello anybody home he called but there was no answer the woman and the children had vanished into thin air suddenly he heard a loud trumpet blast from the city and he unsuspectingly walked outside to see what was going on in the lane that he had just come from there was nothing to be seen the shrill trumpet sounded again it seemed to be coming from the san marco square and he decided to go back there on the way there he noticed that all the streets were surprisingly empty the city seemed deserted except for a few costumed townspeople who were running away in fear he stopped one of them and asked why they were all running away the carnival has been prohibited by decree the man dawdled by the doges they dont exist anymore and the venetian took off the scholar hurried along and reached the san marco square where there were only traces left of the carnival alarmed he looked around even the pillar with the lion was gone in its place stood a new statue a rearing horse with a heroic figure on its back his name was napoleon bonaparte grab that man with the mask someone suddenly shouted michel turned around and saw a group of french soldiers who were heading towards him instinctively their fellow countryman jumped into the air and managed to avoid the guard by flying within a short time there were soldiers everywhere and they pointed to the alleged partygoer who was staying just above the roofs he wont be able to stay up there very long an officer said and had several streets in the area blocked off nostradamus saw the growing danger and tried to flee towards the ocean but unexpectedly gravity got hold of him and he began to descend a company of soldiers rushed to the wharf to grab the lawbreaker by the collar the situation was getting awkward and michel floated down gritting his teeth just in time he managed to turn his fall into a glidedown and finally splashed into the harbor water the soldiers tried to catch him but he dove deep into the water and then hid among the moored boats the next morning the traveler reflected on his confusing dream situations in the leafy park of zan zanipolo this time he had completely lost touch with reality and he didnt even know from which day the dazzling city had confounded him napoleon he remembered but it will be several hundred years before this emperor will actually come into power he estimated and made a note in his journal it is truly miraculous to think that everything and everyone is already in existence waiting for a chance to manifest and that intriguing lady was she trying to offer me some kind of insight or was she trying to protect me from the french danger in any case the danger had passed flying was something that nostradamus had done often enough in his sleep but never before into the future too bad he still had so much ego at the most crucial times he blew it and sank down again tomorrow is the first day of the carnival sir a gardener suddenly mentioned the scholar gave him a friendly nod just imagine if those followers of napoleon had succeeded in grabbing me he pondered while cut branches fell down around his feet i wonder what would have happened then if i want to be safe in the future i will have to be more conscious in my dreams because the higher i go the harder i will fall the gardener who was up in the tree trimming the branches warned him to get out of the way of a large falling branch when did reality shift into that dream michel continued to muse and he decided that from then on he would jump into the air every day to test gravity in the higher worlds there is barely any gravity he knew the higher the world the less gravity there was the scholar got up brushed the leaves off his clothes and left the park so far location had been what provoked his prophesies but he thought it must be possible to some day be able to visit the entire world from one place after a few months in venice michel started to crave change he wanted to travel some more he had checked in with a shipping company and would go on the first ship that would leave the harbor three days later he packed up his stuff and went to the threemaster that had just arrived and was moored next to the shipyard the dutch merchant ship commanded by captain pelsaert was usually used for trade but this time there was little cargo and paying passengers were welcome michel zigzagged through a group of carpenters to the schooner which had a sailor on guard at the ramp providence looked slender compared to the grotesque and clumsy ships of the previous century a fever for discovering the world had broken out among the portuguese and the spaniards and the shipbuilding industry had been making rapid progress ahoy passenger nostradamus he greeted the sailor on watch the seaman gave him a surly look checked a long list of names and then began to speak in dutch michel motioned that he didnt understand to which the crewman responded no nostradamus michel asked him for the list see thats me he said pointing to his name and pronouncing each letter the dutchman sniffed loudly and made a money gesture blijckende penning ping ping the frenchman paid him the traveling costs in advance and stepped up onto the ramp of the sailing vessel smartaleck treasurer he mumbled scornfully while he jumped aboard and walked towards a handful of passengers who were awaiting instructions by the main mast are you going to malta for business too a pushy chap asked to which the scholar gloomily shook his head the venetian understood that he was not going to get anywhere with this guy and began to jabber at a lone lady nice ship isnt it madam it took three months to build that long she asked then the fellow went into an elaborate explanation about sanding the wood before captain pelsaert asked for everyones attention he welcomed the passengers in italian and told them that they just brought a load of delft porcelain to shore and were now taking spices to sicily the ship was from amsterdam the city that was becoming enormously popular the dutchmen traded in pepper nutmeg cloves chinese tea coffee sugar and of course cheese the captain was called away by a crew member during his little speech and walked away where was that rotten smell coming from all of a sudden apparently the tide was right for departure they cast off and the schooner was carefully guided out of port by some rowboats out at the seagate the jib was set as the first sail and the ship went into the open ocean assisted by a light breeze nostradamus put his belongings in his cabin and again he caught a whiff of a nasty odor one of the crew members pointed out to him that the ship had transported slaves in earlier days the smell of destruction was intolerable below deck and michel hurried back outside to the fresh sea breeze where the passengers were bidding a sentimental farewell to a fading venice i prefer to face the future he thought pleased with himself and sauntered across the landing to the front of the ship at the prow he thoroughly enjoyed the grand view while the bow whipped the ocean water into foam it almost feels like youre a bird flying over the ocean like this he imagined after relaxing for a while he returned to the poop deck he saw pelsaert standing on the forward deck where the helmsman was just taking over the wheel from him a good time to meet the captain michel figured and he padded towards him are you coming to check if were keeping the ship on course pelsaert asked absolutely we will soon sail past an island with sirens and i am curious to see if you can completely resist them been reading odyssey by homers the captain supposed yes but only in greek well well we have a scholar aboard i can read too you know but i dont have much time for it reading maps of course is something i do regularly do you feel like coming to my cabin and seeing my collection of maps michel accepted the invitation and they chatted while they walked to the largest quarters on board pelsaert had incredibly foulsmelling breath and his entire cabin was permeated with the odor the physician was about to advise him to rinse his mouth with alcohol but he stopped himself maybe at our next meeting he thought the captain spread a map of the adriatic sea on the table in front of him see this is how were sailing around the boot of italy and he traced the route for him right here we have to watch out for pirates nice map his guest commented by the flemish cartographer gerardus mercator i have some more of his and he proudly brought several land and sea maps out of a trunk these are the best ones there are he continued theyve been developed with a new projection method there are a lot of mistakes in the old maps and they say that thats why columbus got onto the wrong route when he was trying to find an alternate way to india pretty handy those maps michel agreed but the position of the ship can be measured much better using the stars pelsaert laughed selfassured absolutely without the jacobstaf we would be lost and he took a strangelooking instrument that could measure stars out of a drawer see besides the tilt angle it gives the number of degrees of the latitude he explained the device must be pointed towards the pole star his guest supposed so you know something about stars as well pelsaert said as he was putting away the jacobstaf some yes i studied astrology for years and what do you think about this the captain asked placing a beardedman jug on the table the face on the jug was supposed to be a likeness of himself but it didnt look much like him um im not crazy about it michel answered in all honesty pelsaert reacted a bit grumpily and let it be known that it was time for him to get back to work but not before he tried to impress his guest with a collection of silver pennies the silver pieces were indeed beautiful the scholar thanked him for the interesting visit and then spent a bit more time standing outside in the wind when it got dark everyone went to their berths while the ship lightly bobbed up and down during the night the waves got a lot bigger and the schooner surged violently it kept michel from being able to go to sleep after a while he felt seasick and the versatile man blamed himself after four days they finally sailed around the boot of italy and sicily was on the horizon maybe i should go ashore here michel considered im never going to have sea legs that night the passengers were served a bizarre mush for dinner in the galley it was called hutspot good to keep the sea monsters away the ships cook said and gave everyone a generous portion are there sea monsters around here someone named giuseppe asked frightened certainly a month ago we had to flee from the cracken a gigantic sea monster that can capsize the whole ship and hutspot protects us from that sea monsters dont like hutspot the cook clarified and the dish was immediately devoured by giuseppe after that nonsense a catholic priest on his way to preach on malta interrupted did you personally see this monster who supposedly doesnt like hutspot well no actually i was in the galley the cook defended himself its all based on stories exaggerated by fear and ignorance the priest continued and the group of table companions breathed a sigh of relief the cracken isnt that some kind of giant octopus with enormously long tentacles nostradamus then resumed yes exactly see i was right our scholar even says so the cook happily responded i think i may not travel through to malta tomorrow michel promptly announced and the little group of passengers again became nervous but you know there is a much greater chance that we could be attacked by pirates the cook mentioned okay thats enough scary stories the priest reprimanded him there is a lady in our presence long after dinner in the dead of night the ship sailed into the bay of syracuse and the anchor was dropped michel was dozing in bed with a high fever and wondered what was wrong with him am i seasick or was it the hutspot he wondered the dutch meal lay like a rock in his stomach a traveler in the same cabin heard him moan and informed the ships physician he came waddling in half asleep to check up on the case the captain who couldnt sleep also came by and his foul breath blew all over the patient rinse with mouthwash three times a day michel suddenly raved deliriously hes talking gibberish the ships physician observed sadly he will have to be taken ashore as soon as possible he will be better off getting treated on land early in the morning the patient was brought ashore in a sloop and taken to a hospital in syracuse providence resumed her trip to malta that same day after days of illness the sicilian doctor still couldnt figure out what was wrong with his french patient who was shaking like a leaf better do some bloodletting to let the evil juices flow out he thought no nostradamus protested loudly when his arm was grabbed the sicillian was startled and refrained from the treatment despite some moments of clarity michel was having a hard time getting his thoughts straight it took a lot of effort and he kept passing out the high fever continued and the local physician again decided to resort to bloodletting until an arab unexpectedly tapped him on the shoulder i want this man to convalesce at my house because it is too noisy for him here i will take full responsibility for him oh mr alghazali the physician exclaimed snapping to attention the patient was transported to a splendid house on the ocean where a mildmannered woman nursed him with great devotion the care the seawater and the quietude did wonders for him and the fever finally started to abate a few days later he was standing on his own two feet and his mysterious benefactor came to see him i see there is some progress the man with the dark brown eyes said yes absolutely but who is it who has helped me so unselfishly i am abu hamid alghazalieuropean name algazel but my wife fatima is the one who did all the work i only ordered to have you brought here well you saved my life michel thanked him his rescuer was ingratiatingly silent while the surf sounded pleasantly in the background we are both not of sicilian origin abu then remarked yes i agree i am from france and you baghdad persia the arab who was dressed in wool from head to toe answered how did you end up on this island my wife and i settled here because there is a sense of free spirit here but i must leave you now because it is time for our prayers we will meet again soon the muslim left the room and the patient focused his attention on the ocean and followed the action of the waves the next day he was strong enough to share the midday meal with alghazali and his wife the beautiful thing about sicily is that the arabic and christian cultures can meet here abu said in passing his guest nodded in agreement while the humble fatima placed some bowls on the table are you homesick for the provence the moslem man continued no not really i left there many years ago and now i travel all over the place i think you are following the path of the heart you have quickly understood me michel replied surprised and what is it that keeps you busy i try to live according to the insights of sufism a mystical movement within the islam i also publish works in my mother tongue too bad i dont speak arabian or i would have loved to study them but maybe you could tell me something about your books abu thought for a minute while his wife was bringing in a hot dish the elixir of bliss is the title of my latest work he then gave as an example oh i thought the islam was based on subjection michel said no not at all many muslims probably do believe this but the koran and the strict rules of the sharia are only outward appearances allahs true message is love so that is the message that saved me from a precarious fate you must be blessed my dear friend i havent noticed much of that in the last few years his guest grumbled well life is not always what it seems and always gives us difficult tests but perhaps a woman will soon come into your life who will soften the way for you somewhat fatima meanwhile served the soup and the arabic couple began to eat in silence due to their restful presence there was no urge to speak anymore and their guest peacefully enjoyed his meal with them after a week he was feeling great and it was time to travel on is the eagle about to fly again abu asked when the recovered physician wanted to see him the latter smiled meekly how can i thank you live that is enough the moslem answered from his heart michel embraced him and offered him some money but abu declined absolutely the frenchman thanked his wife too and then he was on his way alone again the southern part of sicily consisted of picturesque plains but when you looked to the north you could see etna the largest volcano of europe threateningly rising up out of the landscape in the town of syracuse nostradamus found out that the area around the volcano had been hit again by earthquakes for the past year a big plume of smoke had already been visible above the top which was covered in snow his interest in the mountain was awakened and he proposed to himself to plan to climb it he thoroughly tested his physical condition for the risky undertaking everything seems to be functioning properly he decided with his last knee bend and he bought an old officers hat as protection from the burning sun during the walk to the volcano he spent his nights at hospitable farms when he had crossed many plains the level of the land seriously began to rise the trip was getting heavier and etna was getting bigger the soil around the foot of the volcano had become very fertile the sicilians grew citrus fruits olives grapes figs wheat and barley there the volcano apparently took and gave life michel visited one last farm and inquired about the situation with etna youve got to be nuts to climb that mountain for your own pleasure the farmer frowned i crave danger well its your life and the farmer explained the best climbing route to him the next day the eccentric left civilization behind him he soon came to some pine trees growing around the rocky giant he orientated himself ate an orange and resumed his trip through the forest which quickly changed into a bare rock face the ground was now getting significantly steeper and the adventurer had to stop to catch his breath in the distance he discovered the bay of syracuse the ships looked like little pinpricks so small and vulnerable reminds me of humans he philosophized and he got ready to put his pack on his back again i am so lonely he suddenly lamented i miss my family and even my own country and suddenly feeling terribly homesick he hung his head okay this is no time to get sentimental hanging from a steep mountainside and determined he continued his journey on his left he could see a hole with lava and water vapors were wafting up from it fire earth water and air maybe thats why im here to experience the building block of life etna seemed safe enough according to the last farmer there hadnt been a new eruption for years nevertheless the volcano spread a lot of smoke which was visible everywhere in the area youre going to keep quiet arent you michel kept climbing but the blood drained from his face when he heard a loud bang as a cloud of ashes was ejected the volcano dust spewed out of one of the side walls but it was not an eruption of the central cone alls well false alarm after a lot of endeavor he arrived at the snowy part where nothing grew except the odd thorn bush the loner looked down into the depths and saw rivers of magma flowing out of several flanks that looks scary am i just being foolhardy he wondered but the weather was fine and it must be possible he finally reached the top and the mighty crater emerged once he had climbed onto the side of it he was overwhelmed with an icy fear he lost his balance and almost tumbled into the crevice just in time he planted his foot and grabbed hold of the ground his officers hat fluttered down into the abyss that was a close call he mumbled relieved while his hat lay hundreds of feet below him on the bottom of the crater why was i suddenly gripped by fear i wonder i had chills running down my spine is it fear of heights or is it from the thin air or the sulfur vapor he really had no idea recovered from his fright he carefully continued on and managed to enjoy the extraordinary beauty of nature after spending some time at the top the climber started to feel chilled and began his descent once he had safely reached the foot of the volcano again he decided to head towards the north that choice would cost him dearly because it proved to be an incredibly difficult path which went along jagged mountain ranges it took weeks before he finally reached the harbor town of palermo utterly exhausted and there he just moped around for a while all this traveling is not exactly warming my heart he thought dejectedly and when he happened to be upon a normandic cathedral and attended the mass he knew for sure he wanted to go back to france michel found a portuguese ship that would take him to marseille after three days of sailing the imposing limestone cliff of the french naval town appeared and the stately forts of saint jean and saint nicolas were still protecting the area the ship slowly sailed into the harbor where part of the wharf was under water because of an unusually high tide that could cause problems for the rhone the scientist pondered looking over the railing after disembarking he found a place to stay in the canebière a centrally located district of marseille then he decided to celebrate his return to his fatherland in one of the many seafood restaurants around the harbor soon ill be visiting my family he rejoiced while he sat down at a terrace on the wharf that had stayed dry a waiter came to take his order good afternoon what can i get for you do you have any sole on your menu no problem as you can see they swim right in here the waiter joked okay i would like one fried in butter please im starving anything to drink yes ill have a beer the lone guest decided feeling in a celebratory mood im probably wrong but arent you that famous physician from the old days um notre or nostre nostradamus yes i am nice to be recognized after all this time ive been abroad for ages and ive just arrived back today then you are just in time the waiter said suddenly serious whats going on well the greatest floods of our history have been happening the entire rhone delta has been flooded due to weeks of rain in the alps and the surplus of river water has nowhere to go because of the extremely high sea level to make matters even worse a case of the plague has been identified wow that could be a disastrous combination michel understood and immediately thought of his family in saint rémy which the rhone flowed past many people have already drowned the waiter elaborated the survivors have been robbed of all of their possessions and almost everyone is homeless the roads have been washed out and the cattle is floating dead in the rivers has saint rémy been hit undoubtedly the entire camargue has flooded and the area is barely reachable if at all but that means that people no longer have access to safe drinking water i dont know about that but the disaster is being handled by the provincial government now and theyre looking for people with medical experience they desperately need a doctor of your caliber well i will roll up my sleeves michel said youd better just bring me a simple meal instead of that sole because im no longer in the mood for a celebration a little while later he presented himself to the local authorities and immediately had two assistants assigned to him after the water level had started to go down the three of them left for the disaster area on horseback to assess the situation and offer first aid men just to refresh your memories again my plan of attack nostradamus told them the only thing we can do for people at this point is to convince everyone that the usual water is not suitable for consumption not even for washing safe water is boiled water or rainwater that has been caught in clean barrels when we get back we will make rose petal pills and then distribute them to as many victims as possible the two men listened carefully they reached the rhone before noon and already spotted several bodies floating in the water and the horses began to act mulish so they dismounted and tied the animals to a tree lets see what killed those poor souls the doctor said and together they walked to the bank where they poked a body with a stick that was floating along the edge try to turn it around then ill be able to see it better the leader requested after a bit of fumbling his helpers succeeded in turning the body over and they saw a face covered in horrific abscesses black death they shuddered wed better keep going the horses will get used to it michel said grimly the first flooded village they reached with great difficulty turned out to have been hit simultaneously by a flood of the plague the streets were flooded and dead human and animal bodies floated in the puddles the calamity tidings were beginning to take shape and nostradamus feared that this was the greatest catastrophe he had ever experienced in his life it was painful for them to have to look at the broken down villagers but after giving them their information about the water there was nothing more they could do for them and they continued on their way between the grand rhone and the petit rhone were pools of death and the horses continually refused to go on in all of the next villages the situation proved to be the same the grim reaper had done his work and the only choice was to die either by drowning or the plague in the village of ulain fear reined and some of the survivors clung onto the three riders in desperation michel had the greatest difficulty keeping control over his mount and ordered them to let go what are you guys doing here then they called in desperation bringing you advice about how to use water the doctor answered youre only bringing us words yes but if you follow my advice you have a good chance of staying alive get lost another villager scoffed and they suddenly began to throw rocks and sticks the mounted trio hurried away after having rushed through dozens of villages they reached the fork of the river where the petit rhone split off from its big brother michel knew this area like the back of his hand and they would soon be riding into saint rémy his place of birth the population proved to be decimated i wonder if ill see a family member alive he thought sadly and he left his men behind and quickly rode to the rue des remparts where his parents house was looking deserted he dismounted anyway hoping to catch a sign of life but he found no one and decided to go to the town hall for information the only official there knew that one of his brothers was propping up a house that was about to collapse at the edge of the city nostradamus immediately jumped back on his horse and raced over to it a moment later he saw bertrand standing there holding a wooden pole in his arms michel you alive his brother shouted recognizing the rider right away and threw his pole on the ground they flew into each others arms and allowed their tears to flow freely father and mother michel asked hurriedly they havent been alive for a quite while bertrand sobbed and what about my other brothers hector drowned and i havent heard anything from julien he lives higher up in aixenprovence antoine is still alive and is working at the municipality of arles so we actually survived the flood relatively well but why havent we heard from you for so long oh too much has happened to be able to tell you all right now but to make a long story short after the death of my family i went crazy for half a year michel answered we had to hear the terrible news from the municipality of agen back then i still feel guilty bertrand the plaguefighters family killed by the plague he said briefly lapsing back into that other time so youre repairing houses that are collapsing yes and there is an awful lot of work to be done as you can see well wed better get back to work then i have a few mountains to move myself but ill be back for a visit soon and each went their way when the worst of the flood and plague was past nostradamus settled in the town of salon the provence where the general population welcomed him with open arms he decided to stay there permanently after one year he had built up a new practice at the place de la poissonnerie besides this he made ethereal oils and home remedies again and published some booklets about cosmetics and hygiene it was the beginning of a prosperous time the only thing that was still missing was a woman a herd of white horses ran as the wind and a flock of flamingos rose up and then descended again a little further on the doctor on his mare galloped through the camargue the stretch of wilderness where he found strength and peace in his spare time it was so enjoyable to be able to ride through this beautiful countryside full of lakes and lagoons a wonderful place for water fowl he left the swampy heath behind him and steered his horse in the direction of the dunes a black storklike bird nervously darted off on top of the dune he stopped and stared at the seas horizon for a while the camargue was like an island divided by the mediterranean sea and the river arms of the rhone the ageold sediment of the river water with its tidal activities had given the landscape a special character it was constantly changing and every time he came here there was something new to discover the only stamp humanity had been able to place upon this watery plain were the perfectly straight tracks from a distant roman past he led his mount to the wide sandy beach and let the wind blow away the many impressions left by his patients in the distance he saw the dark profile of a bull disappear behind a hill he was urging his mare on hoping to discover more wild bulls when he heard a horse trotting behind him he turned around and saw a woman on a jetblack stallion the rider wearing a red headscarf passed him without a greeting and disappeared into the dunes it looks like shes following something i want to investigate this he thought and he spurred his horse on in the same direction his curiosity aroused he observed from a dune top what that the tough woman was doing she seemed to be racing like a maniac after a group of wild horses leaving great clouds of dust in her wake seagulls cormorants birds of prey and others of their ilk all dispersed at once shes herding wild horses he determined astonished id better give her a hand and he rode down the hill and brought his horse to a gallop several flamingos with plankton in their beaks were startled by the unexpected visitor and immediately stopped feeding their young excuse me he nodded pleasantly after he had crossed a wet part the ground became dryer and he was able to bring his mare to full speed meanwhile the sheman was screaming at the wild horses and she sped after them like one possessed high above her groups of whiteyellow herons flew in formation in the blue sky at a safe distance from the noisy scene michel managed to catch up to her while calibrating the direction of the untamed horses which were fiercely being kept together by her a number of the animals threatened to get away to the right and he quickly cut them off she noticed but continued her activities without any acknowledgement ive never seen such a presumptuous woman he chuckled to himself she rode around on her stallion completely selfpossessed and despite her masculine inclinations she had a nicely proportioned body but what kind of woman would wear trousers michel meantime did what he could to keep the animals together but he was not a very experienced rider and kept floundering she was still ignoring him some of the horses now tried to escape through the smaller woodsy areas but they didnt stand a chance and were driven back by both of them this game continued until he again tried to control the animals on uneven ground but had to give it up his mare stumbled and he fell with a thump on the ground he hurt himself considerably and the dragoon rode up to him to see how serious his fall had been the herd of animals dispersed im sorry i ruined it for you he said you said it she grumbled while she got down from her horse she didnt try to hide her chagrin all in one piece she then asked a little milder i think so and he felt his body but where do those horses need to go nowhere nowhere then why are we doing all this work we i never asked for your help she had a point there and he introduced himself my name is michel de nostredame and may i ask who you are anne ponsart gemelle but let me help you up and she firmly grasped his hand you are a strong woman he complimented while she helped him up yes sometimes men are afraid of me to tell you the truth ive never met such a robust woman you herd those wild horses just for fun yes i love to spend time here exceptional for a lady of any standing im from salon de provence i work there as a physician and where are you from from istres near the lagoon of berre and i must say i have heard of you before dr nostradamus please call me michel shall we ride a bit all right and they mounted their horses while they were riding through a green landscape anne began to thaw a bit and talked about their surroundings sometimes there are bears in these woods bears ive never seen a bear here and he surreptitiously studied her form aside from her wide shoulders her body was actually quite feminine he now saw she also had a beautiful face with even features and her thick goldenbrown hair stuck out from under her headdress when they were crossing the salt plain anne  relaxed now  told him about the waterfowl and pointed out several species they enjoyed each others company and he wanted to know more about her do you have a love in your life he asked deciding to be straightforward but that was a bit too direct for her this place has a great supply of salt she answered avoiding the question he pushed on a healthy young woman like you must have a husband im a widow she explained irritably and he didnt say anything else for a while they reached the beach and slowly walked along the coast back to istres been a widow for long he carefully asked after a while nearly three years thats good timing he thought and when they had arrived at her house he decided to invite her over for dinner the invitation was received positively and they set up a time his maid had given the house a good cleaning and michel was making his preparations in the kitchen when everything was ready for the afternoon he put on his best clothes and waited for his female company to arrive finally she knocked and he nervously opened the door good afternoon mrs ponsart gemelle i thought we were on a firstname basis she answered contrarily and stood in the doorway somewhat awkwardly the tough woman from istres was wearing the same garb as before not particularly elegant he thought a little disappointed and he felt a bit uncomfortable i think ive overdressed for the occasion but please do come in anne entered the living room and he caught her scent she smelled nice anyway and her clothes had at least been washed well michel i hope your cooking skills will be acceptable if you dont trust them you are welcome to assist me in the kitchen momentarily i see youre still wearing your work clothes anyway he said sharply anne was surprised at her host who seemed to know how to put her in her place im going to change into something more comfortable go ahead and have a look at what i have prepared so far he continued and proceeded up the stairs she walked to the kitchen and poked around a bit she saw a variety of cut vegetables cheese fish eggs and squares of dough on the counter just above all this she discovered a rack with dozens of spice jars in a cupboard she found containers with dried mushrooms besides these there were rows of pots of marmalade each made with a different kind of fruit according to the labels the iron griddles above the fire were glowing hot and ready to be used wow hes really going all out she realized i think i may have underestimated him michel returned wearing more casual clothing and had a stack of paper in his hand look my cookbook la traite essential for anyone who wants to know more about exquisite recipes you wrote a cookbook yes but it hasnt been published yet but roll up your sleeves now see those pieces of dough over there you can brush them with a beaten egg and then sprinkle it with some sesame seeds i will grease the baking tray and while they were working they talked about their lives do you still miss your late wife she asked a little later yes sometimes i do she will always be in my heart stir that cream cheese very gently anne and mix some chopped capers in with it are these the capers not much of a domestic goddess are you meanwhile he baked the puff pastry till it was golden brown and poured the melted cheese sauce with vegetables over it his guest was mesmerized watching him place little pieces of smoked salmon on top of this and then cover the whole thing with squares of crispy baked puff pastry all done lets sit down ive never seen anything like it she said her eyes widened supernatural he grinned and carrying the plates they walked to the dining room where he poured a glass of red wine for each of them it tastes absolutely fabulous she informed him i apologize for underestimating you thank you youre a good equestrian you have an amazing horse by the way you must be rich my husband had a salt factory ah thats why you mentioned salt when we were riding around in the camargue it must have been a successful business yes very much so the salt is exported to many countries the camargue is the largest salt extraction area in europe my husband jacques had a fatal accident in his own factory and so i felt i had to sell the company thats sad he said what kind of stool is that anne asked looking at the strange object in the corner of the room he got up and picked up the copper tripod it is an occult instrument i use for my meditation youre a funny guy she laughed suddenly a flame ignited out of nothing only to extinguish itself just as quickly in the same corner bon sang he exclaimed what on earth was that anne asked startled i dont know it seemed like magic they let it sink in for a while and then resumed eating are you coming with me lets make the pommes dauphines he said after the appetizers and they went back to the kitchen half an hour later the steaming hot main course was on the table did you cook for your husband much he asked while he shook some nutmeg over the entrée no not really i think im just too careless for it but that doesnt mean i cant learn if you want i can show you the ropes some time he suggested when they had finished the potato dish the chef still had a delicious dessert in store halved peaches with whipped cream and shredded almonds if youre trying to impress me you have succeeded anne praised him after she tasted the dessert after dinner they cleared the table and then amiably did the dishes together in the kitchen pretty those pots of marmalade she said while she put away the dried glasses thats jam marmalade has little pieces of peel in it jam doesnt he explained oh i didnt know that how do you make it wash dry cook and add sugar is it really that simple michel nodded well i guess maybe i should develop my female side anne said youre fine the way you are and they left the clean kitchen behind i had a wonderful afternoon but its time for me to go home now she said at last youre welcome to spend the night if youd like its a long way back and it will get dark within the hour anne thanked him she said her purebred would only take half an hour to get her home at the door she unexpectedly kissed him on the mouth and was gone before he had a chance to recover smiling he walked back to the living room cast a glance at the place where the mysterious flame had appeared and spent a few moments enjoying the memory of the pleasant time spent together then he waddled upstairs and happily crawled between the sheets a narrow high mountain with a steep side was silhouetted and the top looked like an opened calyx a castle was perched on its edge it was shaped like a ship that looked as though it was ready to sail away a bit lower someone was climbing a rocky path to the fortress which seemed like a link between heaven and earth he approached some soldiers who were standing guard at its entrance nostradamus is that you at last a young man with a halo who was just joining the guards called out the dreamer didnt know what to say and the man read his discomfort youve arrived at a higher state of consciousness you have met the right woman he clarified how so michel asked you have been awakened by her the visitor took a minute to let this sink in but where do you know me from he then asked weve been watching you on earth for some time now the man whose name was tristan answered once your spirit has penetrated to these higher regions you automatically become a member of the brothers of light hosanna in excelsis but lets not tarry come with me were just preparing the manisola and i will show you what were up to they entered the castle which had many rooms and corridors and which was built with the positions of the sun in mind they passed large groups of transparent people who were busy preparing for the coming festival look the druid room filled with flowers tristan said while scanning the crowd i want to introduce you to my friends but i dont see them just now are these all people who have fully awakened like me michel asked no these are servants there are very few like you and i and he stopped someone where is isola i dont know the passerby answered if you see her tell her we have a special guest oh and they need your help at the banquet then the two proceeded towards the main room where drinks snacks and flower arrangements were being placed on a large round table the priests were making sure everything was running smoothly this reminds me of the last kathar fortress on the montségur michel commented it is tristan agreed but that means that everyone here will soon be killed by the catholic armies the visitor concluded no not at all you havent arrived in the twelfth century after christ time does not exist here and our ritual festivals and initiations go on eternally really it is safe here ah there is isola an angellike woman with long blond hair and blue eyes appeared in the midst of the activities she had a divine aura and was the picture of purity isola i want to introduce you to nostradamus how wonderful to meet another pure spirit she said after the introduction the newcomer was shown around some more and they visited the occitan room which had an impressive floor mosaic in its center there was an image of mary magdalene with a dove on a crescent moon and underneath a snake twisted with an apple in its mouth while michel was taking it all in some worshippers carrying bowls of raspberries blackberries currants and other kinds of fruit walked past them then the pair walked outside to wait for the opening of the festival on the surrounding terraces in the meantime they looked at the foothills of the pyrenees i just saw people from every continent michel mentioned do they all belong to the kathar community it is more a gnostic society tristan indicated which welcomes catholic protestant jewish islamic and other believers converted atheists are also received here with open arms it looks like its not causing any problems no it doesnt here but our free spiritual outlook is often seen as a threat elsewhere and that was the reason why the last gnostics to be out in the open were murdered en mass but they only left a physical shell behind why did they not flee michel continued to ask our predecessors made a holy vow a long time ago to allow the catholic armies to kill them after a conquest of the mountain knowing that their liberated souls would go to the higher worlds where god manifests himself in the purest form i would choose life were not all cut from the same cloth the selfsacrifice was meant to create this eternal place a place where we can continue our sacred work unseen without them this would not have been possible is selfsacrifice not too much to ask it was a free choice i have also vowed not to let myself be subjugated by earthly matters but come i see the festival is about to begin they walked back to the main room where hundreds of initiates and followers were already waiting do you see that man over there asked tristan that is parsival an exceptional being i will introduce you to him they proceeded towards the man with the heroic appearance your first time in the grail castle parsival asked yes and it is quite a revelation to me michel admitted i used to leave this castle as ignorant as i was when i arrived in the beginning he warned i assume you have found the way since then certainly but i first had to live a life of hardship you are from the age of chivalry the newcomer continued during that time everyone was always looking for the holy grail did anyone ever find it many have the grail is actually a symbol for the space where god has mixed the materials of the creation with sunlight the searching soul has to fight his way through this barrel of paradoxes to reach the eternal life i meant did a tangible grail ever exist wait and see parsival said smiling then one of the high priests at the round table asked for everyones attention and stood up to address them today we are celebrating the manisola in honor of jesus christ the son of god and his wife mary magdalene the priestess of the goddess isis with this celebration we are commemorating the last supper where jesus drank from the chalice of the holy water of life after his crucifixion joseph of arimathea collected his holy blood in that selfsame cup the servant passed it on to mary magdalene who took it with her on her journey she was carrying jesus child and to ensure his safety she moved to france she finally gave birth to the child here at the montségur we kathars are therefore the descendents of jesus christ we are the keepers of the inheritance of the culture of the essenes which was the culture that jesus and mary magdalene came from she later founded mystery schools in the languedoc wherever she went therapeutic springs spontaneously appeared we have been celebrating the manisola for centuries but this time is a special year a soul has come to us by his own power and for this joyful occasion we have brought out the holy grail we have prepared a drink which can give him access to the most high a servant handed the priest the grail which was filled with a liquid nostradamus would you step forward please he then asked the newcomer was amazed as he walked up to the round table you are our beacon of light on earth and we wish you all the power and wisdom to complete your mission the priest continued and then he offered him the chalice michel took a drink from the holy grail and a shimmering energy took hold of him long live nostradamus everyone in the room cheered and now lets have a great festival the priest ended his speech harpists began to play celestial music and the revelers spread out into the decorated rooms where they enjoyed the displayed delicacies some people chose silence and went to the surrounding terraces the weather was cooperating and everyone had a great time it was late in the evening when suddenly an alarm was sounded by the guards the castle was under a surprise siege and the soldiers who were standing guard were attacked by a shower of arrows panic ensued and the followers due to lack of orders ran in all directions some tripped over kneeling priests who wanted to surrender to their destiny several high priests with a horde of guards in their wake rushed up to parsival and tristan we want you to pass on the religion quick there is an escape route but we have vowed to stay here eternally they resisted the high priests urgently pointed out to them how important it was to preserve the existence of their religion the communal interest was first and foremost and thanks to the intense pressure and chaotic situation parsival and tristan reluctantly agreed michel had been observing everything until they called out to him too please go with them you are very important you are going to hold up a mirror for humanity so they can see what will happen to them so that their eyes can be opened and the light can prevail he didnt know what to do other than to agree the head of the guard was instructed to show them the way and to raise barricades behind them if necessary farewell and keep our memories alive the high priests said goodbye and looked on with heavy eyes come there is no time to lose the guard commanded and he dragged them along to a remote part at the same time a loud bang made the castle shake on its foundation the enemy armies had managed to enter the hall and kathar soldiers had to seal off the central room in all haste the followers who were left behind in the conquered area were slaughtered to the last man meanwhile the three chosen ones were taken to a landing which was finished with extraordinarily beautiful cedar woodwork the guard stopped there and carefully studied the wooden paneling which consisted of various diamond shapes he began to meticulously feel along the seams with his fingers at a certain spot his hand rested and then as he pushed the diamond it gave way a secret passage opened up get in he ordered tristan parsival and michel hastily entered the hidden crawl space the guard followed them and shut the wooden diamond behind him rendering it once again invisible he then lit a lamp and a narrow passageway came into view make haste we dont have much time he summoned and the trio hurried along at the end of this passage turn left he whispered a few minutes later the next corridor was a dead end a ball the height of a man which had a hole in it became visible the battles in and around the castle could be heard here and tristan contemplated staying behind for a moment crawl in here the guard sternly commanded seeing his hesitation the three of them obediently climbed into the rescue device but had no idea what was about to happen the contraption which was made of twigs and animal skins was exactly the right size for three adults and they each found a spot to sit down there are some handles and footholds to hang on to the guard said they had barely settled when he slowly put the capsule into motion the ball began to roll under its own power and the underground tunnel quickly became a vertical track the vehicle ended up in a free fall and its occupants dropped hundreds of meters in a few seconds until the ball jerked onto some kind of ground and then began to roll very fast nostradamus lost consciousness and did not recover in the twilight zone time flew by and everything was there or did time stand still and there was nothing at the end of the tunnel there was a light with an unbelievable number of forms and at least as many colors i am with you he heard someone say powerlessly he opened his eyes and to his great surprise he saw annes face upsidedown and with her goldenbrown hair right up to his nose ive been holding you for hours she continued worriedly you were freezing cold and i thought you were dead michel pinched himself for assurance yes he was back on earth how did you but he was too weak to finish his sentence she understood and explained it to him at home i was suddenly wide awake in the middle of the night and something told me you needed me desperately i immediately got my horse out of the stable and rode over when i ran into your bedroom and saw you lying there motionless beside your bed i was afraid i had come too late but fortunately you were still alive then i managed to get you back into bed and warmed up your body until your temperature was back to normal oh dear anne thank but she interrupted him by laying her fingers on his lips no need to thank me and she kissed him she sure is the right woman he thought deeply moved and tears of happiness filled his eyes when he tenderly touched her the steel frame around his heart suddenly began the melt the pain from the last so many years disappeared in a flash and his soul was enraptured will you marry me he asked beaming anne smiled from ear to ear and immediately said yes love between a man and a woman the most beautiful kind of love there is moved through him and they fell asleep in each others arms michel woke up late in the morning and realized he was alone in his bed he jumped up tied a cloth around his waist and hurried down the stairs anne are you still here yes im in here he went into the kitchen and to his surprise all the drawers were open and there were pots everywhere i needed something to eat she explained with a bowl in her hand you can forget about that wrap by the way its not like ive never seen a naked man before and she continued to eat he was looking straight ahead i see you ate my truffle too he finally said you mean that black thing that smelled a bit musty yes that black thing happens to be worth its weight in gold and is very difficult to find oh sorry i didnt know that never mind ill find a new one was this really the right woman a woman with eating binges he thought scornfully did you say something no nothing and he assessed the rest of the damage after a modest wedding party anne relocated from istres to salon de provence to move in with michel who lived in a leaking house of fading glory she decided to take care of the overdue maintenance and her stallion salé was housed in the stables of a friendly neighbor after she had put away her things  on their first day together  she lustfully jumped on top of her husband without warning hey watch it im a delicate scholar not a butchers boy he said while she had him pressed between her legs my late husband never had any problems with it she answered surprised im not your late husband come here and they took off the rest of each others clothes gradually the two got used to each other and one day anne announced she was pregnant for the first time their lives started to develop a nice rhythm and a number of months later when anne was trying to sell some of her husbands cosmetic products paul was born his robust mother began to relate more to her feminine energy and it was visibly good for her her demeanor softened considerably after seven bad years now the good ones had clearly started and every venus year they would be blessed with another offspring one day after the third child was born nostradamus was sitting on the veranda behind the house enjoying spring there were flowers blooming everywhere spreading their sweet fragrances and the trees were full of singing birds a girl from the neighborhood was walking by the adjacent gardens which were alive with buzzing bees he could tell by her basket that she was going to the nearby forest to gather some wood hello lassie he called to her the girl knew him well and returned his greeting politely anne meanwhile was in the attic with some workmen renovating the space into a study she had finally convinced her hubby to only absorb himself in matters that were truly dear to him this meant predicting the future combined with astrology her financial fortune enabled him to do this without worries treating patients only for the sake of making some money was something he had finally stopped doing at her insistence michel bent over his books on the occult while the sun was pleasantly shining on his back he was working on some predictions that would take place during the coming year suddenly he got hit on the forehead by a pea which then fell onto the page in front of him with a splat okay thats it paul he warned his son who was playing with a catapult he had made himself just like his fertile marriage his creative efforts were also bearing their first fruits he had recently been asked by the local council to make a latin inscription for the public fountain at the château de lempéri and his cookbook la traite des fardemens et confitures had finally been published by volant in lyon this morning he was concentrating on his first almanac with general prophesies in poetry form which related to all of europe the work would consist of twelve quatrains this afternoon his brother antoine who had survived the disastrous floods several years ago was coming by for a chat antoine had lately been working as a tax collector in their birth place saint rémy which was situated not far from salon michel anne called from the window above would you come and have a look please her husband hurried into the house but in the living room he had to be careful not to trip over his progeny césar was lying on the floor and was being held in a chokehold by his brother and sister at the same time they were practically tickling him to death father negotiated the obstacle and climbed up to the top floor where he looked at the custombuilt book cases in which his green red yellow and blue bottles had been placed to keep them safe the luxurious new desk stood in front of the enlarged window shutter so the scholar would be able to get plenty of fresh air special chests for his geometrical materials had also been purchased and the looking glass that had been bought in marseille was placed neatly under the traditional roof shutters ah my first impression is that i cant complain i see my measuring cups have all survived michel responded happily and he began to inspect the carpentry work i do have a few comments though he said to his wife a little later and he explained to the workmen exactly what changes he wanted the church bells meanwhile were chiming twelve oclock and they heard antoine calling he was very prompt in sharing the midday meal the brothers had been seeing each other regularly since the water calamity anne hurried downstairs to set the table on the veranda before the maid came with the serving dishes have a seat antoine michel requested while he grabbed an extra chair madeleine and césar had to sit beside their uncle and mother served out the pork sausages those are not kosher antoine remarked neither am i his oldest brother said paul dinner anne called for the third time paul didnt want to come and glared at the intruder from up in the tree he had climbed he kept a close watch on the taxman while enjoying the sausages with vegetables the brothers exchanged some local news everything okay with bertrand michel asked yes excellent bertrand had started his own small building company wonderful too bad anne just had the attic renovated otherwise he could have done it antoine wanted to burst out laughing but he controlled himself what kind of woman gets involved with renovations he whispered to this brother i heard that anne said unexpectedly do you want me to slap you now or later sorry anne no offense intended we complement each other perfectly michel confessed she is the man and i am the woman you two are an exceptional couple antoine murmured feeling a bit confused my husband speaks for himself because i feel like a woman one hundred percent madeleine stop that snatching she suddenly screamed after that ungraceful display towards their daughter michel had to laugh too youre right antoine dont ever pick a fight with my wife i will have to polish her up a bit wait a minute mr professional student she protested its me whos enabling you to make a big splash so whos polishing whom and she angrily left the table it wont be easy to tame that little horse of yours antoine predicted he had to leave after seeing his brother to the door michel got settled in his work chair and again picked up his writing book in the late afternoon the same girl from that morning was walking home and her basket was filled with gathered wood thats funny he thought she looks more mature now than she did this morning hello young lady he called out to her she waved at him and giggled about the word lady because just that morning he had called her lassie it was cooling off and he decided to have another look at the renovated study when he was entering the house he bumped into his wife she was still furious about the comment he made earlier that afternoon apologies didnt help and that day the pots and pans went flying through the house  from annes side one night the scientist discovered a group of shooting stars with his new looking glass in astrological circles it had already been known for some time that pieces of stone or iron would sometimes penetrate earths atmosphere partly burning in the process but these insights had not been acknowledged by society michel had read once that in a distant mythical past meteorites with a diameter of several kilometers had created enormous craters in the terrestrial globe and that this had radically changed the earths climate he was planning to write a letter about it to the governor of the provence who was known for his openmindedness and interest in science the governor will certainly read an essay by a respected astrologer he surmised and knowledge must be shared but in the back of his mind the idea was brewing that perhaps the viceroy would be able to help him along his estimation was correct the governor wrote him a letter in response thanking him for his scientific insights he also mentioned that he was very appreciative of his almanac with predictions for the coming year 1555 which has recently been published in lyon he had been recommending the predictions in higher circles and the work was now selling well all over france the door to success had been opened and michel decided to publish an almanac every year he also thought of a more virtuous task to discover what the future of mankind looked like for the next millennia this work would have the wellfitting name of the prophesies happy with this state of affairs he came down to the living room and saw his wife defiantly standing on top of the dining table surprised he looked around to see what was going on madeleine was on top of a cupboard paul was hanging from the ceiling and césar was crawling on his knees is this a conspiracy he asked no were playing a game come and join us anne called out excitedly whats the game feet off the floor id rather keep my feet on the floor oh youre always so serious she sighed this kind of hurt her husbands feelings and he turned around and went back to his study he always had things to do there even if it was just organizing some of his stuff feeling a little melancholy he was thinking about his grandfather jean who understood him so well when anne came into his room my dear husband i love you even though we often collide with each other my love for you really never changes but maybe you could try to explain to me what goes on in that head of yours and she sat down i dont know if you will believe this he began hesitantly but i have a mission it is my lifes work to show humanity what disasters will befall it if it doesnt come to its senses and sees the truth and my path weighs heavily on me hmm i guess that kind of explains that gap between us but well thats just the way it is she replied empathetically i actually didnt realize your work was so serious so thats why you cant play with the children i am constantly receiving dismal images he continued how awful for you but is that mission more important than your family and with that she of course hit a sensitive nerve he stared at her feeling somewhat ashamed maybe once my task has been completed i hope to once again be one with god he confessed i think we all want that and she stroked his cheek and left him in peace nostradamus soon finished the first part of the prophesies by using the dreams and visions he had been collecting for years in his journals he had picked out the most important predictions and had dated classified and reinterpreted them using astrology he called every chapter a century not to signify an actual century but because each chapter contained one hundred quatrains the fourline verses were virtually unintelligible by anyone else due to their obscure style and because he used a mixture of french provencal greek and latin he had to disguise his messages in this way because the inquisition was becoming more and more powerful and on no account did he want to be convicted again for blasphemy or magical practices while he had a family just to be on the safe side i will also mix up the order of the quatrains he thought and spread the filled pages out on his desk my secrets can only be revealed by an initiate or only solved after the prediction has come true and he mixed everything together once he had created a random order he put the work aside after a bit of navelgazing he sighed running his fingers through his hair he often still thought about his initiation into the higher worlds with tristan and parsival and he would love to know if they had survived the fall of the montségur his vision had been fading again no answers had been coming to him from the source and his dreams were not helping either a few weeks later however the planets were in a unique position and it was likely that they would offer relief at this time in the attic the inspired mystic brought out the copper stool with its mysterious powers when placed at a particular angle the metrically designed stool had a connection to the celestial bodies after determining the correct position he placed a container of water nearby on the floor sitting crosslegged on the floor he moistened the feet and the seat of the tripod and then put in head on it he closed his eyes and concentrated on the fallen angels who had broken their promise not to flee and lo and behold it seemed the time was ripe and by fits and starts he left his body he was floating in a residential room on whose ceiling hung a beautiful chandelier which could not have existed in his time the candles in it were not made of wax but were little glass bulbs that flared up all by themselves the highceilinged room was furnished with red plush sofas mahogany coffee tables some more ingenious lamps and a gigantic mirror with a gilded frame he heard the sounds of some grand orchestral music accompanied by choirs but oddly enough there were no musicians to be seen anywhere the sound seemed to be coming from a box in which a round black disc was turning around all by itself in a corner of the room was a lifesize statue of some hero to be admired the marble statue was made with technical perfection and it depicted a muscular demigod who was proudly brandishing a sword and radiating victory the artist must be obsessed with victory this statue is dripping with pathos michel thought a german in uniform his hair cropped close to his head entered the room and walked to the box with the horn the bombastic piece of music was repeated and while the man was reveling in emotion he called out to someone magda where are you he didnt get a response and he called again louder and then got a response here i am a voice sounded in the distance and a few moments later his wife walked into the room thats the sixth time youre playing parsival by wagner she complained and her husband quickly turned off the record meanwhile the intruder was realizing that this glorification of the age of chivalry was the reason for his presence here and that again there was no language barrier helga has a stomach ache magda continued but why were you calling me im going to be terribly busy in the next few weeks thats why i dont have time for the children and i need you to help me with my speech for the foreign press and joseph picked up a folder okay sweetheart by the way did you know that four hundred years ago someone predicted that in 1939 we would be at war with france and england over poland ah so you read kritzingers book mysterien von sonne und seele he supposed she confirmed this anyway some members of the party told me about it but i havent read it yet his wife magically made the controversial book from 1922 appear and thumbed through it to find a specific passage look this quatrain seems to predict both the cause and the date of the war you can check it against the french original it is shown below it she said french we are about to attack france surely you dont think im going to absorb myself in that language but joseph let her convince him to read the german version and the couple bent over the book while the author observed them from above it must be mine the latter concluded surprised incredible that i am coming across my verses in the future a future whose content i dont even know and he watched dumbfounded here is a striking quatrain which you can certainly use for your speech on reichstag the parliament buildings magda suggested and her spouse read it out loud somewhere in the far reaches of europe a child will be born from poor parents and great numbers will be seduced by his speeches he will cause transformations to a larger germany the führer will love that she said i will give it some thought darling maybe if i give kritzinger as the source the führer and the german people are not going to want to listen to prophesies from a frenchmen from the middle ages from the renaissance she corrected oh dont be such a perfectionist a message doesnt necessarily have to be true it must be simple and repeated loudly and often enough truth is what i decide is true magda but thanks for your interesting contribution who knows it may have some value for propaganda1940 the germans spread fake nostradamus prophesies of war in france but will you please listen to my response to the crystal night for the press conference now and he began but was interrupted by a tinkling sound joseph picked up a horn from a device listened to someone for a minute and then hung up magda the governess wants you to come and pick up helmut and hilde and his wife immediately left the room her husband walked up to the big mirror and started practicing his speech for the journalists all the stories youve been hearing about socalled plundering and destruction of jewish possessions are dirty lies the jews have not been harmed in any way he emphasized each word with a grand gesture until he felt that the statement came across in the way he wanted it to he paced up and down the room for a while and then returned to the mirror to convince himself one more time the great and absolute truth is that the party and the führer are right they are always right suddenly he turned around and asked someone or would you dispute that michel looked around the room for another person the orator could be addressing but he didnt see anyone well would you the german repeated in a harsh voice who was he talking to dont think i cant see you joseph said looking straight up now yikes the man has discovered me for one moment everything seemed to freeze i often see things that other people dont see he continued and i never talk about that with the party or they would think i was nuts but what are you doing here ghost are you here to help or hinder me michel was astounded and didnt know what to say this man must be highly gifted he thought he can see ghosts and is not the slightest bit afraid of them joseph now began to practice his speech in front of his oneman audience we nationalisticsocialists will act only for our voters we are entering the reichstag to avail ourselves of weapons from the weapon room of democracy which have been fashioned by this disposable form of government we are not entering as friends or neutrals but as enemies well how does that sound he asked forcibly another silence followed and michel felt very much put on the spot sorry i cant follow you he finally said oh dear an undeveloped little spirit permit me to teach you something i dont know where youre from but you have arrived in the third reich the empire that is lead by my führer hitler half plebeian half god possibly the new christ or at least a john the baptist he has everything it takes to be king this born tribune of the people and soontobe dictator my love for him is great and let me not be falsely modest ghost i am playing one of the most important roles in this mightiest kingdom on earth i am the brilliant minister of propaganda herr doctor joseph goebbels doctor of philosophy and germanics do you realize what an important person you have stumbled upon here i sort of understand what youre saying michel answered he just couldnt ignore goebbels energy what im doing joseph continued is to sell an idea to the masses in such a penetrating and allencompassing way that they will completely accept the range of ideas and can never again escape it i do all this to please my führer i am usually more nimble with my choice of words but you are only a ghost youre obviously not someone who will make my speeches known worldwide so this is my chance to air my heart are there many people who are enthralled with that leader you are speaking of with such admiration michel asked while flying around the chandelier haha you are clearly a timetraveling ghost yes millions of country fellowmen worship him my wife also adores him she even wanted to be his wife but she didnt succeed so she married me the man who is closest to the führer that hister must be an impressive person his visitor assumed hitler yes he certainly is what our leader wants to attain is the purity and the idealization of the arian race in this way he stimulates the ideal german model family white and blonde ein kind für den führer my seven children helga hilde harald helmut holde hedda and heide all have blonde hair and blue eyes and are particularly suitable for our propaganda see this is a picture of the führer and he held up a portrait of a man with a small mustache michel was getting fed up with the knowitall attitude of the minister the professional orator kept trying to win him over even from his height how should i imagine the purity and idealization of the arian race the seer asked he was dying to teach him a lesson goodness gracious our house ghost can think how charming well i will explain it to you in life there are high quality people and inferior people whatever it is that makes gypsies gypsies or homosexuals homosexuals and whatever it is that makes people mentally ill is in the blood or in the genes can you follow this yes of course he lied all right the diversity of the people therefore has a biological cause now we have noticed that the inferior people multiply faster than the superior classes therefore it is necessary to segregate the inferior types sterilize them or better yet get rid of them altogether otherwise this unbalanced growth will undoubtedly lead to the destruction of our culture this goebbels character is one of the brothers of darkness michel understood by now and he had no intention of being bullied by him is that crystal night related to that too he asked shame on you you were eavesdropping on me earlier but you are smarter than i thought goebbels said the crystal night is a step towards the total annihilation of the jews our party members recently made a fool of those miserly untermenschen by destroying all of their possessions such as synagogues stores and businesses i just heard you say that those people have not been harmed in any way is that an accusation i already told you i twist the truth wherever i see fit dexterity and timing are very important in reaching our goal and a lie can be appropriate in such cases the führer and i want to give the german people what they crave a large pure arian kingdom there is nothing the masses hate more than to look at a matter from both sides goebbels twisted himself out of that one like a snake arent you afraid that the people will discover the truth behind your trickery michel asked he was just beginning to realize what a great evil he had come face to face with no not at all but just as a precaution the party has already had 20000 books by prominent writers philosophers and scientists burned in public scandalous books that lead to moral decadence books with ungerman spirit what we are aiming for will be a blessing for our fellow man and our descendents finally we will be freed from homosexuals gypsies asocial people schizophrenics and the insane we have already sterilized between 350000 and 450000 people the minister kept going on and on and in order to solve the immense jewish problem we are creating special destruction camps where our doctors will have the opportunity to conduct experiments on these impure types for the betterment of the arian race theres no talking to this guy michel thought starting to feel quite distraught you ought to be sterilized according to your own standards you are insane he suddenly exploded i see you are not in agreement with me too bad so this is your true face but not everything that is true is good for the party joseph continued unrelenting if it coincides with the actual truth so much the better but otherwise it will just have to be adjusted michel was burning up by now the german creep was draining his energy what would you think of a poster advertising a new kind of soap the minister started up again would it be best to point out the high quality of a competing brand no even you would shake your head at that look at my argument as the same type of political advertising his visitor was now looking for a way out his energy was so depleted that he had get out of there as quickly as possible he could not keep listening to the propagandist a minute longer if the truth doesnt serve you it must be adapted goebbels repeated and then he turned off all the lights in the room with the flick of just one switch michel was taken by surprise with the sudden change from day to night and began to tumble downwards he tried to grab the chandelier but he plunged down and crashed on the floor my god i have met the devil in person and in a daze he tried to get up that almost always works for disturbing little ghosts like you goebbels chuckled and then he turned on dozens of lights again this time nostradamus got an enormous electric shock and his mental body collapsed there he lay beside the stone hero with the raised up sword and feverishly looked for salvation conform to our ideal or i will have to destroy you the german said ruthlessly wait i can predict the future of the third reich for you the seer said to buy himself some time unseres schönes reich so weiss so weiss and wunderschön goebbles sang completely out of his mind and put on another wagner piece tristan und isolde he informed and again turned off the lights this new shock caused a paralysis on one side of michels body and his powers of perception began to falter the phone rang for the second time and this gave him some respite the minister turned off the music and picked up the horn no theres nothing wrong im just playing with the lights he answered and hung up now where were we oh yes you wanted to predict the future of the third reich to me i am not going to fall for that of course but i can predict that your future is not looking rosy and he again made a sea of light appear because of these hard hits michel could barely think anymore his volatile body was trembling dangerously and was on the verge of evaporating one more attack would have been fatal right at that moment the door opened and magda came in i picked up the children and they are in bed now did you behave yourself while i was gone she asked of course darling ive been practicing my speech he feigned his wife looked at him closely i want you to stop seeing irene it is damaging the führers image she said theres nothing going on between me and her she is just a great actress that i keep close track of we both know better than that joseph you want to be a model family dont you then control your sexual impulses or i will have to inform the führer he sullenly sat down on the sofa and looked past his wife im going to bed now and stop playing with the lights she commanded and then left the room her husband didnt waist a second and eagerly turned around in order to resume his little game but there was nothing to be seen beside the lifesize sculpture the ghost had disappeared just in the nick of time he had returned to his material body which was dutifully waiting for its master that was a close call he groaned the image of goebbels still burned on his retina he pulled himself together and put away the tripod then he sat down at his desk to write down the perilous adventure only by casting my light onto the darkness can evil be overcome he reflected while dipping his pen into the ink anne was pregnant for the fourth time and it was only a few more months before the new baby would be born its going to be a girl her husband predicted while he was working on his second almanac i dont want to know she yelled and covered her ears dont make so much noise youll scare the baby he warned but she wasnt listening there was an unexpected knock on the door and michel went to answer it he returned to the living room with a dejected look on his face take the children upstairs and stay there he ordered whats going on anne responded indignantly how come im being treated like some kind of beast of burden im not going to discuss it right now ill explain later and when she had gone upstairs with the kids he went back to the front door and invited the company in it was a married couple from senas the wife was carrying a hideouslooking newborn child with two heads and four arms they had traveled from toulon without stopping to see the clairvoyant physician the latter scratched behind his ears when he saw the monstrosity while the desperate couple looked at him hopefully what on earth am i going to do with this he thought but he didnt have the heart to send them away and for the sake of formality he examined the fused twins how did you find me he asked while he looked at the back of the ghastly creature the authorities in toulon recommended you the young father answered they told us that you could possibly help us the doctor gave them something to drink after which he briefly concentrated on the essence of the child which did not look very viable i am sorry but your child will not live long he said carefully upon which the mother burst into tears her husband consoled her and they left utterly sad anne came down with the children and asked what had just happened i only wanted to spare all of you something so gruesome that it would only give you nightmares he explained later when the little ones were in bed he lifted the veil of mystery for his highly pregnant wife just a bit which gave her the shivers a few months later their fourth child  perfectly normal fortunately  was born it was a girl just as michel had predicted and she was christened pauline anne got pregnant again right away her husband thought it was just fine although the household was getting pretty busy and the crying and screaming disturbed the tranquil atmosphere in his study the solution was simple a dividing door was placed at the stairwell and the scholar was able to peacefully get back to work aside from ferreting out the events of the coming year and casting horoscopes for all kinds of people nostradamus had made several attempts to find out more about the twentieth century but the trick with the tripod no longer worked in the occult store in marseille he found a new instrument and once he was back at home again he hurried upstairs with the mysterious package he carefully unwrapped the delicate bowl and placed it on the floor then he ran downstairs again to the garden to get some water from the rain barrel boy youre thirsty anne said while she hung up the laundry yes im parched her husband said not wanting to engage in any bickering and he hastily returned to his room with a full bucket today he was going to succeed in visiting hister the great german leader who would cause a world war he was convinced he sprinkled some water into the bowl and added some oil that had hallucinogenic properties then he sat down beside it after staring at the water surface for a while he began to relax and when the ethereal vapors slowly but surely began to intoxicate him he fell into a deep trance suddenly he was attached from behind someone jumped onto his back it was too late to defend himself and he fell forwards dad weve got something for you césar cried out hanging on his neck damn it all he raged scaring the wits out of the boy he had never seen his father angry father was always calmness personified but now his eyes were blazing fire and thunder michel saw his little boy standing there forlornly and immediately felt regret for his outburst im sorry i lost my temper but you came at a very bad time and reached his hand out to him césar hesitated for a second but then held out his hand a bit suspiciously yes my boy evil is in everyone even in your father and it is good to learn to control that force which i just failed to do fortunately we have a conscience they both felt pretty shaken and took a minute to recover michel are you coming down we have a surprise for you his wife suddenly called from two floors below now what and in a bad mood he rumbled down the stairs and landed in the living room where he couldnt find anyone happy birthday anne and the children hooted and came out of the kitchen your present is by the door father who had just turned fifty started to get a headache and grumpily walked to the front entrance but he couldnt see any package and returned to the living room shrugging his shoulders behind the door they chanted he went back there again and grumbling opened the door tatata a horn blared a crowd of townspeople stood right in front of him doctor nostradamus mayor lemerre began it is our pleasure to congratulate you on your fiftieth birthday celebrating half a century all michel really wanted to do was to slam the door in his face but he couldnt very well do that to all of his excited fellow citizens or his family so he had to be tolerant you are a very special person the mayor continued and very valuable to salon the provence therefore the town council has decided to erect a statue of you and we humbly invite you to come and unveil your own image in the town square there was no getting away from it and the glorified scholar was pulled along without delay the celebrating crowd even carried him on their shoulders and brought him to the square where his covered statue stood dear people the mayor called out when they got there our famous fellow townsman has turned fifty today and the council would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him by making him an honorary citizen and has erected a statue of him lemerre asked nostradamus to pull the cloth off the statue and the bronze figure which was a good likeness of the astrologer was revealed a fanfare orchestra began the play and the town council members hurried towards the scholar to congratulate him after this deluge of lavish praise the mad scholar saw an opening and fled around the back the mayor exchanged a few words with the seers wife while the council members enjoyed the free snacks afterwards anne walked home feeling pleased and let the children stay at the square a bit longer to play ball her husband was rigidly waiting for her in the living room i dont ever want to have another surprise like that again he said fiercely i was sitting in deep concentration when you sent césar up to get me my heart nearly gave out pauline who was wrapped up in cloths began to cry its okay sweetie her mother calmed her we always have to adjust ourselves to your weird daddy he seems to think the universe revolves around him deeply insulted he turned away from his headstrong spouse and cursing and swearing climbed up the stairs all you want to do is absorb yourself in all kinds of disasters all the time she shouted after him well we dont we like having fun once in a while he knew he had married an unconventional wife but this time she had gone too far and he locked the door to his attic for good all day long he stayed and pouted in his room but by the evening he had calmed down and went to see anne in the bedroom and told her he was sorry youre right im far too serious and it must be difficult for you and the children to be with me but i cant help the way i am thats nothing new get over here and take those clothes off she said he crawled into bed with her and they lovingly embraced each other i know you need to fulfill your mission she continued and i will support you till the end but at the same time i want to have a life too her understanding soothed him and they made love im so lucky to have you he whispered afterwards the next morning he awoke feeling awful he felt like his body was burning up apparently yesterday had been too much for him anne heard her husband moaning and saw that he was seriously ill should i get a doctor she asked worried i am the doctor and all i need is rest and love he added he was sick in bed for days and his wife took care of him despite her large belly its always something with my scholar she thought sadly while she peeled a boiled egg for him i just have to give him more space it was christmas the biggest holiday of the year after easter the nostradamus family now expanded to five children celebrated the birth of jesus christ in the saintlaurent church it was the first time that a nativity scene had been set up in a church with lifesize statues and everyone wanted to see it the children rushed to the front and paul and césar managed to get right next to the manger with the baby jesus in it mama andré looks like jesus paul called seeing a resemblance to his newborn brother i think andré is more handsome she answered from behind a row of people the bystanders looked at her askance thats sacrilege one of them accused her anne didnt pay it any mind and viewed the rest of the christmas dolls with her husband mary joseph and the shepherds were considerably less popular and a little further on the three kings from the east had the least amount of attention all the church goers were now requested to sit down on the wooden benches where nostradamus quickly told his children about francis of assisi who was the one who had started the use of the barn in this way the monk wanted to carry out the christmas message for the illiterate unfortunately the kids were not as philosophical as he had hoped they were busy looking at the thousands of lights that cast a spell on the room it was time for the christmas play the old arch bishop from arles shuffled to the lectern eager for it to begin ladies and gentlemen christmas is the promise of the new life that jesus brings and this beautiful theme will now be enacted for you enjoy the actors came onto the stage and the audience leaned forward eagerly not all the spectators because michel thought the whole event was a bit dubious before the rise of the protestants such a beautiful christmas performance had never been organized and the bishop had never been so friendly and spoken so briefly the counter reformation was obviously trying to win back souls but any sounds of criticism could not be expected form this parochial public his innocent children were being brainwashed he watched the theatrical play with aversion but as the crowd became more excited he began to yield to the happy atmosphere to conclude there were parades with the shepherds and the three kings which ended at the crib despite the impure motives of the church it had been a pleasant evening and the family returned home after the entertainment that night their sixth child was conceived michel anne called from behind the closed attic door im going out this afternoon and i wont be back until tomorrow morning ill have tea with you before i go if youd like that sounded like a good idea to her husband and he opened the door she entered with a tray of tea and cookies and placed it on his desk where are you going he asked im going horseback riding in the camargue with jacqueline and then im going to stay overnight at her place in istres its been a long time since ive seen my sister i didnt know she rode horses yes she just started recently so you will have to manage without me for a bit but the maid will keep an eye on the children and she poured the flower tea does she still work at that sewing studio her husband inquired taking a bite from his raisin cookie yes and ive asked her to make a long brown robe for you wonderful thanks he said while he wiped the crumbs from his beard they finished their tea and then anne went on her way give my best to your sister he said as she was leaving and they quickly gave each other a kiss he locked the door so that no child could jump on his back this time and closed the windows too it was now practically completely dark in the room and he sat down in his office chair and took a secret pill box from a drawer in his desk in this little box he kept an herb that was used for stimulating the third eye a new experiment he shook the powdered herb out onto his desktop and inhaled it through his nostril in one big sniff nondedju took a bit too much of the stuff he grumbled and his eyes watered with the pain the room suddenly began to spin and he grabbed onto the armrests of his chair but lost control anne he squeaked with his eyes rolling around in their sockets and his body slowly slid off the chair after some time the mystic lying flat on the floor regained consciousness this is not my study he noticed looking around he found himself in a huge room and sat up to take a better look at it the room had an imposing floor mosaic of a black sun the image was made up of symbols from various religions there were many relics in the room and there was only one small window he immediately went to it and looked out ive ended up in a castle he decided there was nothing of further interest in the room and filled with curiosity he walked towards an exit i sense a strange atmosphere here that reminds me of black magic and he carefully descended a stone staircase on the next level below there were more rooms and all the doors were wide open the first one had king arthur room on it in this room there was a round wooden table with twelve chairs around it inspired by arthurian times obviously he thought the time traveler walked around looking at everything briefly touched the chairs and then visited the next room called king heinrich i room here the furniture was made of very advanced materials possibly from the nineteenth or twentieth century he guessed there were a desk metal filing cabinets and a safe on the wall hung a blueprint with the word wewelsburg in thick letters above it that must be the floor plan of this castle he supposed the gigantic project took up a city in a half circle of exactly one thousand meters in diameter and the whole thing was in the shape of an arrow which was pointing due north he nosed around in one of the open drawers in the desk and found that it was full of skull rings a macabre collection he thought in the filing cabinets all the files were neatly arranged alphabetically only a folder with very clear images of a tibetan monastery was lying haphazardly on top suddenly he heard voices and he carefully looked around the doorframe three men in uniform were trudging up the stone staircase the people of germany will have a special leader every one thousand years he heard one of them say you mean me of course the man with the little moustache and a terrifying voice responded that must be hister michel instantly realized without any doubt my führer his deputy heinrich himmler answered it was exactly one thousand years ago that heinrich i ruled the german lands and you could well be his reincarnation the men were now closeby and were preparing to enter the level where michel was how is the renovation of wewelsburg coming along hermann göring asked the castle is as good as ready come i will show you the generals room himmler answered and they continued climbing up the stairs michel could no longer hear the men talking but their footsteps sounded through the whole building after a while the germans came down again and their voices became audible again well great master of the teutonic knighthood göring teased what will be our permanent place the king arthur room himmler replied that is where we will meet from now on michel could hear them from the next room as they sat down at the round table there was a door between the two rooms and he very quietly put his ear on it gentlemen i have asked you come here for a special reason himmler began i would like to present to you my magnificent plans i expect only magnificent plans from you hitler pouted but his deputy didnt let himself be distracted wewelsburg will become the shrine of europe he continued the castle must become a center for a new religion a religion with recognizable gods myths and even its own vatican based on the christian model göring assumed no i want our old arian roots to become dominant that is why i want the bible to be replaced by mein kampf and all crosses by swastikas the clairvoyant karl wiligut has predicted in the past that this place will be a magical germanic bulwark the damned power of the vatican must indeed be broken hitler agreed still there is an aspect of christianity the nations secondincommand said which endlessly fascinates us all and that is the holy grail michel was listening to all of this with amazement they were talking about the magical cup from which he had drunk at his initiation for years our thule society has been trying to get hold of this grail for us because this was supposed to lead to the ultimate power four years ago i ordered otto rahnthe german grail searcher died mysteriously in 1939 the historian to search for the grail in the caves near montségur but he has been searching in vain important information can no longer be passed on to any third parties by him anyway i have heard about other victims during your search hitler commented about a million himmler replied dryly but that is of minor importance in what we have in mind youre already being called the great inquisitor göring joked and the men all laughed yes but listen here is the thing i traveled to montségur myself and searched for several months one track finally led me to the monastery of montserrat in spain and gentlemen i have succeeded i have found the grail nostradamus heard this incredulously that himmler character was even more dangerous than his boss where is the cup adolf cried out excitedly in the safe in the next room i will get it momentarily and proud as a peacock himmler walked to the king arthur room where the overwhelmed seer quickly hid like a little boy with bated breath he watched from behind the filing cabinet how the safe was opened and he caught a glimpse of the holy grail thats not it he thought relieved the original chalice is smaller and has a dent in it meanwhile himmler took the relic and returned to his brothers of darkness my führer the honor is yours and he handed the supposed holy grail to his superior hitler examined the chalice suspiciously and then silently put it on the table then he began to applaud with conviction and looked at his deputy full of pride absolute power is now ours himmler grinned but permit me to place the grail behind locked doors once again herr wiliguthimmlers rasputin and the officers will be here any minute and i want the location of the grail to be known only to the three of us hitler gave his approval and heinrich left the room to put the grail in a safe place again while michel again hid behind the files many guards could now be seen in wewelsburg and soon a group of ss officers arrived they came in and greeted the führer adolf completely ignored them he only had eyes for his deputy who he thought might have something else up his sleeve is goebbels not coming göring asked his daydreaming boss no joseph is working on my speech with predictions from kritzinger he answered indifferently this room himmler addressed the expanded group will be accessible only to the twelve highest ranking officers of the empire after initiation the strictest confidence will be maintained about everything that will take place in this order the vow of confidentiality will have to be guaranteed by force under the supervision of the clairvoyant herr wiligut the summoned medium introduced himself and nostradamus smelled a rat every member will go into the next room at a set time himmler continued while the others will focus their thoughts on that person due to the influence of the knightly force the member will not be able to keep any possible secrets to himself herr göring i propose that you go first michel ducked away for the third time and a fraction of second later göring entered the room and sat down at the desk to wait the closed ss circle then began to contact spirits of germanic ancestors who along with the sounds of the tibetan scale were supposed to purify the room when the sounds died away there was perfect silence for a while göring belonged to the most trusted and he was sure he had a clean slate nevertheless the experiment was making him feel uncertain and he nervously bit his nails finally he was readmitted to the room with his colleagues this is not what i expected hermann what are you hiding from us himmler asked unexpectedly i am hiding absolutely nothing göring replied haughtily well according to herr wiligut you are i am a man of honor and decency and i have always been faithful to the führer then there has to be someone else in that room wiligut surmised thats unlikely himmler said this complex is being guarded like a fortress but just to be sure he ordered his guards to search the next room oh no theyre going to catch me the other clairvoyant realized too late the soldiers found the intruder and dragged him to the group of conspirators their leader rose angrily and looked at him with loathing how did you get in here he snarled but the spy remained silent the führer asked you a question himmler emphasized viciously but michel kept his mouth still shut tightly this will never happen again my führer his deputy apologized throw him into the walhalla and turn on the burning oven we have ways to make him talk the guards took the intruder and locked him up in the cellar where michel came to his senses i completely forgot that this is just an image of the future he realized i was obsessed with the danger feeling somewhat reassured he looked around the room next to the burning oven which was beginning to show signs of life was a container filled with shields belonging to dead soldiers the insignia were ceremonially being burned here fear is my greatest enemy but id better play it safe and not take any chances you never know they might burn me to ashes too the oven is getting hot already and he focused his attention on the study in his home its all about concentration and after he had cooled his head he gradually dissolved ah thats a sight for sore eyes he sighed when he saw his familiar attic he walked straight to his desk to write down the events but was taken aback when he noticed his earthly body lying motionless on the floor beside the chair the body was breathing very slowly and he suspected that it was still recovering from the overdose of herbs he had taken earlier the ghost tried to enter by force but the material body did not respond now what this isnt something you can learn from a book he said to himself soberly and decided to just wait and see the knights from the twelfth century certainly made an impression on those germans he thought i wonder what will become of those monsters and before he had even finished thinking that thought he found himself in a bunker surrounded by nazis who were walking around in panic damn but fortunately no one noticed him these dark characters were absorbed in much more urgent matters sometimes they see you and sometimes they dont it seems to depend on their mood he realized frowning it seems like real life and then a sudden explosion caused the concrete bunker to tremble dangerously and clouds of dust covered the room the nazis were being bombed it was a matter of life and death a large blonde secretary was running around confused by the upheaval and brushed right past the unobserved visitor she is blinded by panic and unable to take in anything else michel observed again carefully he examined the complex where dozens of officers had taken shelter from the battle in the various rooms most of them were lying on bunk beds and they looked as if their last hours had arrived all of the rooms looked in sad shape and were in a state of decay pipes were hanging loosely here and there from the ceiling the walls were cracked and there was junk everywhere between the beds were plastic barrels of fuel in one of the rooms the time traveler discovered six blonde children with blue eyes those must be the goebbel kids he supposed in the officers room he found hitler and his confidants again the bunker shook on its foundation while a telephone operator was trying with great difficulty to maintain contact with the army the führer was trying to rule the remains of his third reich from berlin the quarters were situated right under the reichstag and had a fortified roof several meters thick to protect the leader from the worst possible bombs the russians and their allies are attacking us from all directions hitler yelled but it was just not in his character to surrender nostradamus had a close look at hatred personified every pore seemed to be in the service of destruction kind of funny that i get to put their leader under a magnifying glass like this he thought himmler was there too he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes despondently maybe its not too late to surrender in exchange for our freedom he suggested no we will never negotiate with the enemy we will go on until the final victory hitler rasped while a german shepherd dog was licking his fingers his deputy was staring off into space abandoning all hope the bunker again shook on its foundation the bombings were drawing nearer i think we should surrender too general berger reluctantly admitted listen to me i will never surrender alive hitler hissed in his face berger left the room frustrated so youre abandoning me traitor his leader complained while continuing to give random orders his supporters however were mollified and resigned themselves to the situation which was looking more hopeless by the minute the aggrieved führer walked to his secretary to dictate his last will and testament to her write down he said that i adolf hitler swear that i will rule my third reich even from the grave i sure hope that doesnt come true michel thought standing right behind him the telephone operator came in bearing bad news the partisans have murdered our ally mussolini and have hanged him upsidedown he informed them hitler was put out for a moment but quickly recovered i dont want the enemy to get hold of my body burn it after i die he commanded traudl made a note of his wish eva the führers girlfriend came in with a bowl of water for the dog blondie who eagerly began to lap it up right away where is magda eva asked she was leaning against a stack of boxes containing important document that were supposed to get burned at the last minute i guess she is with joseph himmler replied the contact officer came in again with a disastrous message the ss seemed to have suffered a major defeat at the edge of the city so my army is definitely deserting me hitler scoffed turning purple in the face he nearly had a seizure and had to leave the quarters he retreated to the living room where magda goebbels was lying on the sofa like a wet rag why dont you get those kids of yours to fight for a change he snarled at her she wisely kept her mouth shut and fled from her idol adolfs dream of a super empire was being smashed to smithereens no one will speak to me anymore only eva he whined and dropped down on the sofa and turned on the convention in nuremburg for the umpteenth time it was the highlight of his life and watching the film relaxed him a bit his girlfriend had followed him and sat down beside him adolf i want to marry you today she said you know that i am married to my mission he protested but eva began to stroke him trying to convince him all right we will get married for your sake he finally agreed and while she thanked him with a kiss on the nose the screen showed a gigantic square where hundreds of thousands of people had one arm slanting upward to salute their leader the king of kings with the support of pannonia michel figured out while he watched the führers personal servant came running in what is it now his boss asked herr himmler is gone he fled westwards through the tunnel system send a few soldiers to finish him off um theres no one left to carry out that order the servant answered reluctantly hitler stopped the film and stared ahead looking grim nostradamus was curious to find out more about the deputys escape and left the living room after he had searched through the complex he found a tunnel to the west through which himmler supposedly had fled he was just wondering what to do when he heard a thumping sound from the adjoining room well well if it isnt our house ghost a familiar voice suddenly sounded it was the minister of propaganda who could see ghosts and who had already tricked him earlier by having an undermining discussion with him goebbels was staring at him from the doorway with a strange expression on his face this time i must not let myself get carried away by this idiot michel resolved too bad you left so soon the last time goebbels said to him i guess you came back to have a look at how we meet our destruction but he who laughs last and he began to laugh hitler came walking up joseph i need you as a witness eva and i are getting married ill be there in a minute im just talking to someone theres no one here joseph youre seeing ghosts again but hes right there and he pointed in michels direction hitler took out his pistol and fired several shots at the place where the phantom was supposed to be not anymore come along and keep your mouth shut some startled officers were running in with their machine guns and asked what was going on i just shot a ghost their leader sneered pulling goebbels along with him michel meanwhile was sliding down to the floor the bullets had gone right through him im dying he cried but his higher body was merely rattled there were sounds of wedding music coming from the living room adolf and eva were really tying the knot at the last minute the ceremony didnt exactly go smoothly they were interrupted by several serious explosions the enemy was now laying siege to the city with great force the german shepherd was frightened by the shooting and lay down next to the collapsed ghost the only spot to find any comfort underground this was lucky for michel because the animals warmth helped him to recover remarkably well instead of fleeing he decided he wanted to see the finale of the war drama to be on the safe side he kept away from the psychic goebbels as he closely watched the downfall of the nazis after the wedding party the führer announced that he was going to commit suicide and wanted to be left alone when he was alone with eva he dribbled a few drops of something into the mouth of his faithful dog blondie fell down dead and was whisked away to a corner of the room he must have tried out a poison michel understood indeed the king of kings gave some to his brandnew bride and then took some himself they both fell asleep forever then the personal servant entered the room and shot his employer in the head for good measure the last few followers dragged the two bodies upstairs to the backyard along with the important documents and burned everything good riddance the seer who had accompanied them mumbled before going back into the bunker again to witness everything until the last minute who else is there he wondered while he moved through the building in the childrens room he found more horrors goebbels six children were lying in bed dead by poisoning i bet father and mother did that michel suspected and then he found them lifeless behind the door justice has prevailed however that evil genius is still on the loose and he resolutely moved towards the tunnel through which himmler was supposed to have escaped he carefully entered the dark corridor but he soon scraped himself on the foundation damn this is going to take more strength than i have left he worried in the distance he saw some light it didnt last long however because it turned out to be coming from hitlers secretary who was trying to save her skin defeated she was walking along the trail with a lantern he squeezed past her and went on an underground train station soon appeared and some faulty lamps lit up large groups of women children and elderly people they had been hiding there from the battles in the city and were waiting for the end of the war sitting on the platform michel flew past the arches and the despondent faces and left the ubahn station behind him while following the trail westwards he painfully bumped into the tunnel wall again ouch he cried out but it was not earthly pain merely a disturbance and he increased his speed the next station loomed and intense fighting was still taking place there fanatic ss members were murdering deserted soldiers who had been entrenching among the hiding civilians no time to stop the ghost decided and sailed past the berliners who were fighting for their lives the tunnel seemed endless until the way was suddenly barred the underground had caved in and a bit of daylight was shining on the heaps of rubble michel looked at the ruined ceiling and slid his supple body out through the opening he came out in west berlin which had been flattened to the ground huge fires were making black clouds and the odd row of houses was still standing here and there the allies were steadily making their way through the last of the streets towards the inner city bloody corpses were lying everywhere among the debris and fallen trees a bunch of droning objects suddenly flew out of the clouds wow theyve succeeded in building flying machines the seer exclaimed euphorically then reprimanded himself for his childish reaction and concentrated once more on finding signs of himmler from the sky he discovered a british control post which was obstructing the way of outgoing traffic some horseless carriages were being inspected there were thousands of soldiers but they were all marching towards the city center he had lost the trail and returned to the collapsed tunnel to look for clues eureka behind a mountain of debris he spied an officers hat with matching coat bearing the badge of the highest rank in the country that nazi got rid of his uniform he realized and scanned the whole area he had flown over the control post a few times when he noticed himmler he was just coming out of a barrack and was accompanied by a british commander himmler was pretending to be a simple deserted officer and trying to make a deal the ghost landed right beside him in the grass and heard him lying the scoundrel was making up some grand story and was whispering about some great reward the british commander seemed to like the idea and was looking around to make sure he wouldnt get caught by his comrades but chaos reigned and the british as well as the american soldiers only had eyes for the last of the resisters this was the right moment for shady deals and the men went and stood behind a tree to do their scheming deal the brit finally agreed and they clinched their bargain just as some dark clouds above them suddenly opened up the sun broke through the opening and shone exactly onto the dark event himmler was lit up and so was nostradamus who unexpectedly became visible are you the one who will pass the last judgment the unscrupulous german asked when he saw him the supposed judge gave him a silent but meaningful look i spit on you himmler said without a grain of remorse then a mysterious arrow flew from the sky through the clouds and pierced his heart this definitely marked the end of the third reich does my presence actually make a difference or doesnt it michel wondered the locked door of the study was forced open and anne stepped into the room with trembling knees afraid to find her husband dead inside after she had arrived home the maid had informed her that the scholar had urgently requested to not be disturbed for any reason he was conducting an important experiment but now she felt it had taken too long he hadnt been out of his study for days and now it seemed like her worries were justified she found her husband lying on the floor hes dead she wailed couldnt you just knock michel asked he was surprisingly lucid for a moment she was speechless but then she got very angry youve kept yourself locked up for three whole days we called you so many times we knocked we wailed and you wouldnt open the door i couldnt stand it another minute im fine he calmly assured her you could have been dead she continued still very agitated i had no choice but to act and by the way the queen wants to see you i thought youd probably want to know about that that is good news indeed ill get packed right away and he started to get up to get ready dont be an idiot first youre going to spend a few days getting your strength back you look horrible she shouted and her husband promised her he would take it easy for a few days where did daddy go threeyearold pauline wondered the next day at breakfast daddys taking care of the hereafter césar answered pass the bread please father asked his son passed it to him i think he was playing tricks again paul said daringly your father is losing his hair but not his mischief anne agreed her husband took a drink of fruit juice and was amused by the banter your father is going to visit the queen soon mother informed everyone paul let go of césar paul had quite the temper and was often restless i hope the queen is not too pretty cause then we would never see daddy anymore madeleine commented i only want your mother he reassured her and anyway the queen is already married to the king well ive heard that marriage is just a sham anne remarked and there are plenty of mistresses at the court what are mistresses mom pauline asked they are woman who are not married to a man but love him anyway she tried to explain simply then there are a lot of mistresses around this table césar joked his parents laughed and then started to clear the table would you stay with andré a minute anne asked her husband who was back to normal kept an eye on the baby while she went to shake out the tablecloth in the garden the first part of the prophesies had been a big hit at the kings court and queen catherine de medici requested the immensely popular astrologer to come to her palace to give her a consultation a greater honor could not be bestowed and nostradamus granted her wish because paris was a long way off he would have to be away from home for about a month he said goodbye to his family with a heavy heart here guys forgetmenots but his kids were already running outside because they were busy with other things father loved them all no matter what they did but he felt most connected to césar a bright boy to whom he might be able to pass on his knowledge some day be careful there is always a lot of hate and envy at the court anne pressed upon her husband ill stay out of it all he promised and after a big kiss he picked up his suitcase and climbed into the waiting carriage the guest to the royals would take the opportunity to visit his publisher chomarat in lyon too he arrived two days later his publisher shook his head in disbelief when he saw the famous writer walk into his office unannounced i will have to get the guest room ready he stammered great thanks im only staying for one day though because im on my way to paris then i will show you around the office right away and he gave him a tour of the maison thomassin the topographers were also taken aback by the surprise visit and awkwardly made room for their exalted guest at the printing press their boss began to speak nervously your success is partly due to this invention said chomarat holding on the revolutionary device tenderly as if it was his own child he asked one of the workers to put some ink on the template for the cover of the prophesies he did as he was asked now i will show you how it works chomarat resumed and he placed the inked form on top of the bottom plate and then we place some paper on top and you may make the print yourself nostradamus started to turn the plate down with a winch i wish being under pressure was this easy he said jokingly but before anyone had a chance to start laughing the publisher cried out in pain his thumb had got stuck and his guest quickly turned the plate back let me have a look at that the latter requested moaning chomarat showed him his wounded thumb do you have some bandages with his face twisted in pain he pointed to his office they went there and after a bit of searching found a small piece of bandage you wont be able to write by hand for a while michel said as he bandaged the thumb im a printer not a writer chomarat grumbled he had now recovered from the shock and the men went back to the work floor once there nostradamus turned the plate down again so that it was firmly pressed against the piece of paper and then turned it back again botched up work must now be a thing of the past he chuckled and then had a look at the wet print marvelous but whats that little devil doing there on the last line chomarat was surprised and came over to stand next to him and also saw the irregularity what rascal made this change he said angrily but no one on the staff seemed to have done it their boss ran to the supply of his clients books for a minute he had visions of thousands of reproduced devils but thank god all the covers were okay they corrected the print template and after all the commotion the litmus test was passed the author was very happy and looked at his own work again which was getting published here in several languages his books were being eagerly received all over europe afterwards he and the publisher went to a restaurant and chatted a bit more about improvements to the current version the next day the journey to paris was resumed everything went smoothly and three days later they drove past fontainebleau it wouldnt be long now suddenly a group of horseback riders surrounded the carriage and forced it to stop bandits the frightened coachman called out but it turned out to be police officers and reassured he followed their directions an officer soon explained to the passenger what was going on your route has been changed you will be escorted to the palace in saint germain en laye why the change nostradamus wanted to know the royal couple changes residence every so often so we have yet some distance to go my apologies for the inconvenience officer morency sat down beside him and they continued on people sure do a lot of traveling these days the police officer began to harp while he was taking off his riding boots the world is flourishing after those dark ages and is now making rapid progress see those migrant birds up there flying north michel interrupted yes why they can do it ten times faster than we can so what are you trying to say that i was born in the wrong time period i still dont get it morency said oh dont mind me im just feeling a bit grouchy probably just tired the scholar apologized i will leave you alone doctor i suppose everybody pesters you all the time well now that you mentioned it i must say the intrusiveness is getting worse every day in my own town i cant even go out in public anymore but you go ahead and keep talking because pleasant hours fly fast morency spoke about his career and his retirement coming up you will be arrested and jailed before your career is over the clairvoyant suddenly said the officer looked at him crestfallen what are you saying right before i retire keep your chin up a peace treaty will give you your freedom back i dont know what to make of all that but i will keep it in mind amazing you can see those things well events just kind of hang in the air and i observe them the way a bird feels a storm coming except humans in contrast to animals usually cause their own miseries unbelievable do you see your own future too the officer asked impressed personal matters unfortunately cloud my vision well i appreciate the warning are you catholic yes why there is political battle going on here between the catholic house of guise and the calvanistic house of coligny the queen has chosen the guises side so youre in the right place but beware of the parisian courts because they are fanatic and look for the slightest excuse to convict anyone and i am thinking particularly of your publications a rain shower just starting was tapping on the roof of the carriage and the men chatted till the end of the ride there it was finally saint germain en laye the town that kings enjoyed so much because of the pleasant climate and which was surrounded by huge forests the minute the carriage came out from underneath the foliage the weather cleared up then they bumped alongside seemingly endless royal gardens under construction the gardens will have terraces with a view across the seine morency remarked it looks like it would take a whole day just to walk through it michel responded yes about that and then there are about five thousands hectares of forest henry ii is a fervent hunter the carriage was now moving past the new palace which was still surrounded by scaffolding cartloads of materials were moving to and fro and groups of workmen were working on the construction the guest however was taken to the old castle situated just behind it i wonder how many rooms this place has he asked when the colossal palace came into view over four hundred the new one will have even more his companion answered the police officers on horseback veered off and the carriage stopped at the entrance the men got out and walked towards the towering entrance doors which were opened by two valets they entered the magisterial entrance hall where two spiral staircases were elegantly entwined my job is done good luck the officer said sincerely the scholar said goodbye and sat down on a gilded sofa and examined the interior while he waited wherever he looked every spot was decorated with the utmost care even the ceiling was decorated and to think that the new castle was to become the real showpiece a head valet asked him to follow him to the throne room where the guests were generally received the royal couple were waiting for him on their golden thrones between them hung a striking painting of a woman with a mysterious smile the mona lisa collection of king françois i nostradamus so glad you are here catherine de medici spoke resolutely and her guest bowed deeply as custom demanded henry this is that famous astrologer from the provence who has been causing such a commotion she informed her husband he used to work as a physician and saved many of our subjects from the plague the king gave the illustrious countryman a sidelong glance his white countenance contrasted sharply with his black widebrimmed hat with the brown feather nice to meet you he said for forms sake another one of those intellectuals well hes your visitor catherine you take care of him yourself he thought to himself michel saw right through his pretenses what the king really wanted to do was to go hunting im very curious about your talents the queen who was wearing a leather cap resumed and i would like you to come to my private living quarters tomorrow morning at eight oclock to further discuss it certainly your majesty he thought she was a lot more intelligent than her husband on monday next week there will be a feast she continued in honor of the marriage of the duke of joyeux and the lady de vaudemont and tonight there is a banquet we invite you to attend both michels heart skipped a beat when he heard the last name of his first wife de vaudemont unbelievable the bride must be a sister or niece of yolandes my former relatives will not be happy when i show up there he thought an inevitable confrontation hung in the air the king passed gas and was wriggling uncomfortably on his golden seat thank you very much for the invitation your majesty i will be sure to attend our guests are expected to join in with the court dancing after the performance do you know these dances catherine asked not at all your majesty then our ballet master will teach you the required steps some time in the next few days but tonight we shall see each other at the banquet and she ordered her valet to see the astrologer out of the throne room the summoned dance teacher promised to start with dance lessons that same day but first the guest would get the opportunity to take some rest somewhat recovered from the heavy trip nostradamus walked to the ballet studio where balthazar was waiting for him still travelworn sir a little but some movement wont do me any harm i will also teach you some courtly skills since these are inextricably connected to the dance his guest thought that was fine and started by taking off his overfrock for the court dance clothing actually must be impeccable the young ballet master giggled but in any case it looks like you are looking forward to your first dance lesson and he put the coat back on do you know anything about the dance dance is the female hunt and hunting is the male dance the scholar answered well i will hang that proverb above my bed balthazar giggled again he was an easy fellow to get along with slippery as an eel michel thought on closer inspection okay wed better get started because the de vaudemonts will be here in two hours they are my next students do you know the de vaudemonts well no i only know that they belong to the nobility our queen uses every opportunity to organize a party balthazar said unabashedly and he began the lesson a courtier must have a general education but above all he is expected to be able to move elegantly everything that is done at court must be done gracefully and effortlessly stiff movements or visible exertion are considered sinful the gentlemen moved to the dance floor at the ball the dancing will follow set patterns for example like this and while the ballet master counted the beat he demonstrated a few steps at the same time you have to follow the social rules follow me please and michel copied a pas de bourré thats quite challenging he said when his legs got all tangled up together i will give you a series of exercises on paper which will help you control your motor functions the instructor suggested good that will give me something to do i suppose ballet is catherine de medicis favorite activity youre right nobility can be recognized by ones posture according to your queen unfortunately her husband disagrees with her and it was she who brought the refined manners to the french court she brought a varied company of cooks artists and musicians back with her from florence after the wedding you will get to meet them and they continued dancing just when michel thought he got the hang of something he got all mixed up again and the affectionate ballet master would take him by the hand in closing they practiced a figure dance after which the first lesson was over tomorrow they would continue it was late in the afternoon and michel walked outside to get some fresh air he walked through a park where several gardeners were planting shrubs in passing he looked at the development of the new castle up ahead behind a flower bed stood a courtier who suddenly began to wave wildly at him well well if it isnt that marquis de florenville my past is once again coming to haunt me it was indeed the castle lord who had tried to trick him in the past and the marquis excitedly rushed over to greet him i guess hes reformed now that im famous the astrologer thought scornfully what a privilege to see you again the blueblood greeted him yes its been a long time yes it certainly has and we havent gotten any younger have we do you still go to strasbourg michel asked lately ive been staying primarily at the court for political matters de florenville answered while the sun disappeared behind the horizon it was getting colder now and the scholar indicated he wanted to go back inside what kind of political matters are you occupying you he asked when they entered the palace together well thats a long story weve got an hour before the banquet starts michel said and the marquis began to talk my friend erasmus whom im sure you remember felt that certain parts of the bible were not translated correctly from the latin he told while they walked through the corridors he then translated the greek new testament and had it published the german luther elaborated on this and his protestant movement blew over to france a few huguenots from strasbourg asked me to represent this movement in paris and i could not refuse them hence i am here have you ever heard of the colignys yes i heard about them recently but doesnt that make you the political enemy of the royal family from a formal point of view yes de florenville agreed but the king does not bother with politics and catherine thinks that the guises are too powerful she actually tries to get closer to us that wicked witch pardon my french set the guises and the colignys up against each other i didnt know there was such inclination towards protestantism michel said well it is growing on a daily basis especially in northern france there are even some supporters among the royal family but tell me something else what are you doing here and the marquis looked at him expectantly the queen has asked me for a consultation the seer revealed ah and what were your findings the politician asked fishing for spicy details i am not going to speak to her majesty until tomorrow and i am not at liberty to discuss the content of the consultation with anyone professional confidentiality what i can tell you is that the king is not interested in astrology well everybody knows that the marquis waved off his comment henry ii happens to be interested in absolutely nothing but it has been whispered that he has taken possession of all of the church treasures to build the extremely expensive chateau see thats the trouble with catholics theyre so hypocritical except for a few good ones of course stealing from the church is not a problem for me i think it is far too powerful anyway the scholar was becoming quite well informed about the political snake pit through all this gossip and he felt he had heard enough i still need to get changed see you at the banquet he cut off the conversation and then climbed up the central spiral case to his room on the third floor a little while later the groomed seer entered the dining room where a grand banquet had already begun two long exorbitant tables were set up with about five hundred guests seated around them the celebrity was escorted to the royal couples table by an usher the two were each seated at the head of the table so there was quite a distance between them the other table was for members of the lower nobility which was where the marquis had also taken place the astrologer was seated across from the de vaudemonts surprisingly and when they saw their former family member they stiffened they nudged each other in astonishment to alert each other to the arrival of the calamity prophet they were yolandes brothers and sisters although they had become old and grey they were easily recognizable their parents had probably died the bride turned out to be elise the daughter of désiree and by her side was duke de joyeux they still hated michel and his presence spoiled their feast all kinds of delicacies were being served in the meantime and the summoned astrologer managed to enjoy them despite the sour faces across from him the queen now proposed a toast to the future bride and groom and everyone unanimously raised their glasses only the king didnt because he was too busy amusing himself with some of the ladiesinwaiting michel was able to discern from bits and pieces of conversations around him that catherine was descended from a rich bankers family and that the french royal family would be strengthened by this henry ii was cleverer than he seemed after the guests had eaten their fill boredom set in and the conversation became caustic and repressed the subject changed to politics and with lots of guises and colignys in the room the tension began to mount during one fierce dispute nostradamus was asked to predict the religious future of the royal house there was a great deal of interest everyone wanted to know what the explorer of the heavens would say about this in eighty years he spoke eloquently i see a sun king being born in this palace but will he be a protestant pressed de coligny the leader of the group with the same name he will be a christian anyway the seer answered cautiously nevertheless things got out of hand after that and a shameless argument ensued michel decided he had had enough after the dessert while the queen looked on despondently the next morning he visited catherine de medici in her private quarters she had clearly decorated the room according to her own personal taste because it was full of paintings of rich ancestors posing in front of their residences in florence come and sit beside me the queen ordered and michel sat down on the sofa would you like a treat she asked while she held a bowl of candied fruit in front of him thank you your majesty and he picked out one of the exquisite candies and are you enjoying your stay here so far aside from that quarrel last night well i am certainly impressed with all the grandeur and magnificence thats the idea a lot of money is spent on seemingly useless matters such as parties triumphs and palaces but this is how we attempt to impress foreign ambassadors so that we can do better business and with the money earned we can strengthen our army a cunning woman he understood im sure she leads the country from behind the scenes i have requested you to come here she resumed because i would like you to draw up a horoscope for me everyone is talking about you and i am very curious to find out what the stars have to say about my life can you do that for me yes i certainly can but i will need the exact data of your birth catherine immediately ordered a valet to go and get the birth documents how many hours will it take she asked unfortunately it takes several weeks i dont have the necessary equipment with me and i can only work properly at home well that is a misunderstanding on my part then but okay i will have to be patient is there anything you could tell me now i will first have to concentrate your majesty go ahead and nostradamus closed his eyes he soon entered other worlds and his head began to nod i see i see that the court ballet will experience enormous development because of your efforts special academies for dance will be founded that is good news i adore the ballet do you see anything happening during my lifetime as well something about rome is coming through thats quite possible the late pope leo x who was established in rome was my second cousin giovanni di lorenzo de medici the queen was sitting on the edge of her chair by now hmm ruling is in your blood he mumbled do you mean that i will rule the country yes thats coming but does that mean my husband will no longer be alive she asked startled michel nodded sympathetically henry and i have a marriage of convenience but i sincerely hope that this will not come true nothing is written in stone your majesty everything is subject to change but the divine ideas are revealed to me and every idea is true it is only a question of how and when if the seed of a beech tree receives little water or light the beech will possibly never appear but it will never be an oak could you tell me what will happen to my husband maybe we can do something to prevent it it is not clear in my mind and i also dont want to unnecessarily discredit your husband but if your husband wants me to i could look into it more deeply slim chance of that she said and then suddenly changed the subject catherine suddenly stood up and let her dress drop to her feet startnaked she looked at him seductively and do you think im attractive well he stalled cautiously yes im no longer a slender maiden for the real boss of france you look very good and he bent towards to her hmm and you smell nice he said pressing his nose against her waist i air my body every day she explained i wish everyone was so wise alternating hot and cold baths is very good too and he stroked her buttocks catherine coquettishly enjoyed his touch well your health is excellent the doctor said then you can put your clothes back on gosh you are almost as crafty as i am and amused she put her dress back on the valet came back in with the birth documents our wish is for a strong stable france and the maintenance of the power of the royal house of valois the queen resumed with a serious look on her face can you advise me how my husband and i should handle the politically religious fractions in order to achieve this i will first draw up a horoscope for you your majesty after that i will give you some insights into your strong and weak points after which you will have to put the knowledge into practice yourself you see i am not allowed to lead the life of another no matter how much i want to satisfy your wishes bon i appreciate your integrity we will leave it alone for now then we shall see each other next monday at the ball and she ended the conversation it was eleven oclock in the morning the time the theatre spectacle in honor of the wedding of duke de joyeux and elise de vaudemont was to start wearing his simple knickerbockers michel walked into the gigantic ballroom and paraded through the extremely dolled up guests some of whom he had already met in the palaces all the ladies looked like works of art very wide dresses with extravagant head dresses the gentlemen too were wearing fabulous hats or expensive wigs and both sexes moved through the room with exaggerated formal movements someone pressed a program into michels hand lets see what it says he mumbled and opened it the famous astrologer had of course been noticed already and three eager ladiesinwaiting rushed up to him mister nostradamus how nice that you are here they called out and you like the ballet well i cant really say im fond of it but i am certainly curious to see the performance of my dance instructor in the piece ballet comique de la reine he admitted but the ballet comique de la reine is the name of the company angelique the lady in the blue hat corrected him what are they performing then circe by homer ah one of the bestknown pieces from the odyssee the scholar knew de beaujoyeux also did the choreography collette the lady in the pink hat butted in i am not familiar with that one michel said its in the program she continued i hadnt had a chance to look at it yet ladies and again attempted to look at the paper when the third lady imposed there will be singers dancers musicians animals circus artists and more she informed him the room meanwhile had filled to the brim with thousands of courtiers and guests from the entire country i suppose this is the first de medici party you have attended collette asked yes indeed this is my first time he acknowledged youd better brace yourself then angelique warned the ballet alone takes four hours four hours of ballet dont worry during all the performances you can freely walk in and out collette reassured him i should probably help you familiarize yourself at the court angelique offered i know my way around here much better than she does said collette not letting her friend bully her i think that his lordship would prefer to practice discrimination the third ladyinwaiting outdid her competition the ladies suddenly couldnt stand each other anymore im happily married and i have beautiful children the astrologer asserted good day ladies he tipped his hat and continued on his way the audience was on three sides of the performance area partly in the galleries where the king and queen and the wedding couple sat and partly below where michel joined the crowd the performance started and an impressive set mechanically moved into place a dance choir performed an aubade for the newly married couple and acted out an allegorical treatment of conjugal love after the modest tribute the atmosphere became exuberant and colorfully costumed actors paraded back and forth after some time a cry of delight went through the room as a real elephant stepped out of the wings all stops were pulled out various exotic animals trotted past followed by hordes of marching soldiers imitating a battle the audience gazed at the spectacle in admiration and it raised the kings spirits to see his armed forces henry ii even rose from his chair for a minute when the captain of his personal guard entering into a duel with a scot look before you leap montgomery called out affectedly to his enemy the two militia men stood and faced each other on the stage with full arsenal the scot began the attack brandishing his sword at the captain but he skillfully warded it off with his shield it was an electrifying performance and the captain prepared for a counterattack in all the excitement the king forgot it was just a play and spurred montgomery on from the balcony get him captain he shouted through the room the audience decided to choose him as their favorite and loudly cheered him on darn now i know what will kill the king a practice duel michel suddenly knew montgomery was distracted for a moment by the frenzied audience the scot cleverly took advantage of his confusion he tried to viciously pierce the captain with his sword but it glanced off his helmet missed the spectators shouted with joy i think im going to have to lead my own guard the king grumbled to his wife but montgomery now took the lead and after a collision between the two warriors the scot fell down on the ground after which the captain raised his sword over the head of his victim in victory a red curtain fell in front of the stage and the possible deathblow was left to the imagination of the audience while the set was quickly changed everyone had the opportunity to get something to eat and drink the political games still continued de coligny who was standing in front of nostradamus gave an obvious signal with his hand which caused several party members to silently leave the room which was noticed by some of the guises what a bunch of idiots the scholar thought and paid no further attention to them the entire stage again turned around spectacularly and the set for the ballet comique de la reine appeared the audience sat down again and saw the ballet master jump onto the stage first balthazar was playing the role of the sorceress the story was acted out by the dancers in pantomime the ballet took a long time indeed and the courtiers regularly walked in and out of the room halfway through the performance mercurius descended the messenger of the gods was brought down with a winch it almost seems like hermes is following me the astrologer contemplated among a lot of noise the dancers interrupted his reflections about the signs from above and then balthazar showed off a ballet tour de force oh dear soon i will have to put my best foot forward and michel mentally went through the dance steps he would have to put into practice after the performance when circe by homer was over all the dancers jumped down from the stage and requested everyone to join them the nobles streamed onto the dance floor while the rest of the audience watched with interest michel also joined in with the bassa dance which incorporated a lot of bows and turns however because of the geometric patterns and the tight clothing the participants looked more like marionettes than like people dancing the king and queen had come down from the balcony and were ceremoniously striding across the floor with the de vaudemont family following in their wake catherines coneshaped dress was so large that five grown men could have fit beneath it her husband wore long shoes whose points were so long they kept everyone at a distance after the basse dance the queen got up to speak dear friends please move to the side for a moment i would like to request the bride and groom to come onto the dance floor and start the figure dance elise de vaudemont and duke de joyeux came forward and the couple began to move elegantly to the courtly music one couple kept getting added and the dancers formed long rows which then formed into circles or triangles michel followed the figure dance from the sidelines the dance was an especially esthetic pleasure for the spectators the de vaudemonts attention was now completely absorbed in the dancing wedding couple and they lost track of their sworn enemy i wonder when that low point of the evening will happen the seer thought to himself because the hidden tension was very perceivable to him a dansehaute please catherine suddenly ordered the musicians as if she had heard his thoughts it was the dance where everyone had to continuously switch partners by taking a little jump aha this will be the collision a duet with one of the female de vaudemonts michel smiled as he stepped onto the dance floor despite her enormous dress the queen was also participating and after changing partners a few times she arrived in front of nostradamus i feel like weve know each other for years doctor she said coquettishly her favorite guest looked at her with a little twinkle and gracefully turned her around my compliments she exclaimed afterwards you really have the hang of it and she jumped to another dancer while the scholar received a new lady he saw that elise would be his next dance partner the bride had just come to the same painful conclusion and was desperately trying to make eye contact with her family members a loony girl just like the rest of her family michel assessed shes not going to play along i wonder if shell bow out altogether the eyecatcher of the day was furiously looking for ways to get out of the dance but finally she couldnt really do anything but take the customary little jump and ended up in front of the seer may i have this dance he asked with a piercing look in his eyes and elise pretended to faint the people around them reacted emotionally when they saw the bride falling down and the musicians stopped playing duke de joyeux much to his dismay saw his wife lying on the dance floor and rushed over to her his inlaws were suddenly riveted to the spot someone get the court physician he called out panicking the queen decided otherwise and resolutely walked to the place of the incident mr de joyeux there is already a physician present she said quietly dr nostradamus she continued as a physician surely you can tell us what is wrong with the bride i dont immediately see any objective changes your majesty please have a closer look at the lady she requested and he bent over elise and checked her heart beat just for show ill wangle it for you girl he whispered and after performing a few more little tests he addressed the groom your wife is suffering from a vasovagale synkope oh and what does that mean the duke stammered it means that she fainted and she will soon come to she was probably just feeling a bit overwhelmed the king was interested in the incident now too and came to take a closer look at the slumped bride well thats not uncommon around here he remarked at that moment elise began to pretendcough and started to make gestures of trying to get up can someone please help her husband asked anxiously family members rushed forward and helped the affected celebrant off the dance floor where she was assisted onto a chair catherine ordered everyone to continue the party and the festive atmosphere was restored during the popular suites the king unexpectedly got into the spirit of them and did a dance with his wife youre in a good mood today henry she said falling girls are good for me he joked and they turned around to the beat of the music theyre not partridges she replied when she faced him again you are right my dear wife shooting down partridges is much more exciting the suites came to an end and the de vaudemonts left the room sending one last murderous glance to the evil magician after the festivities there was a closing banquet but michel also decided he had had all he could take and left so he could get some sleep it had been quite an eventful day the next morning the scholar took leave of the queen before going home a valet saw him into her quarters is everything as you wish doctor catherine who was just meeting with her council men asked yes your majesty but i am here to say goodbye i am leaving shortly oh i am sorry to hear that on the other hand you will be doing my horoscope and she ordered the councilors to leave the room for a moment i wanted to praise you for your actions last night she continued when they were alone you mean that incident with elise de vaudemont yes indeed you solved that problem very discreetly acting is not her strongest point but why the resentment it looked as though the de vaudemonts were ready to drink your blood that is ancient history your majesty i was once married to a de vaudemont he said it in a way that conveyed that he had no intention to supply any further details oh well all right i wish you a pleasant return journey doctor and im sure we will see each other again and she presented him with a generous payment for the work yet to be done she said goodbye to him with a seductive wink michel had barely sat down in the carriage when he suddenly felt pain everywhere in his body it felt as though all of his joints were on fire it must be gout he diagnosed himself worriedly you will have a sick little bird at home dear anne during the long journey back the inflammations kept flaring up and with great difficulty and in a lot of pain he arrived in salon de provence feeling broken he got out of the carriage and walked toward the front door taking laborious little steps oh no not again his wife thought as she watched him through the window and saw him struggling id like you to go out the back door and go play outside for a while she instructed the children they disappeared without argument im afraid i cant welcome you with joy she moaned at the entrance i hope they didnt poison you and she caught her husband as he began to fall no this is much worse it is becoming chronic he said anne barely managed to get him upstairs and into bed please stay and lie down with me for a while i longed for you so much while i was gone he requested and she crawled under the blankets with him he discharged when he felt her skin against his oh this is doing wonders already and he fell into a deep sleep it took several weeks before he felt like himself again and then he got busy right away in his study he carefully began to draw up the queens astrological chart let me see she was born on april 23 1519 she is a taurus with a scorpio ascendant he understood from the tables some woman he mumbled a little while later when he was filling the twelve houses with the astrological signs calm strong shrewd socially adept and with jupiter in the fourth house she is not going to lose her possessions it is not easy to make her mad although with the sun in the seventh house and the moon in the tenth house that will get repressed she must occasionally get very jealous and when she does she is not capable of being forgiving watch out it looks like the house of valois will be in trouble after her death after he had completed the queens character description he sent the horoscope to her right away the smell of food cooking rose up the staircase to the attic anne was busy in the kitchen ill have to go and take a closer look at that michel thought he put down his quill and sauntered downstairs the nutmeg is all gone she said when he came in ill pick some up at the market tomorrow he promised as he sat down on a stool at the kitchen table hey tomatoes he exclaimed sniffing around ah my lord is clairsmelling too she teased youll be getting some spaghetti bolognese on your plate in a minute probably a more simple meal than what you got at the queens palace but it will have to do madeleine came in is dinner ready yet mom she asked almost you might as well go and get paul and césar now and her daughter ran outside antoine is coming to have a bite to eat with us too anne informed her husband thats nice ill set the table for the occasion he said and walked into the dining room with the linen the children came bounding in a moment later full of zestful energy and ran to the set table hey calm down you guys father warned and he brought andrés highchair closer diane the smallest one was still being fed by the maid whats that weird sound im hearing michel wondered out loud thats andré with a rattle césar said mom bought it for him yesterday father walked into the living room and saw the toddler playing with the tin toy he took him into the dining room and put him into the highchair there was a loud knock at the front door that must be antoine the door is open michel called and his brother came in hi antoine great youre here well rising star any news from the royal front no i just sent the horoscope the lady of the house meantime put the spaghetti on the table and asked her husband to go and get a jug of wine from the cellar been picking up lots of taxes lately antoine anne charged ive been promoted to inspector her brotherinlaw suddenly beamed well well were all so lucky arent we congratulations and are you in charge of our district now because in that case we shall have to arrange a private meeting with you i really cant treat anyone with favor he answered seriously i was kidding anne explained they dont exactly have the greatest sense of humor those nostredames she thought and she placed the low goblets on the table her husband came back in with the wine children you will have lemonade today he said and they began to cheer your brother has just become inspector his wife informed him thats good news are we in your district now michel asked but antoine wouldnt meet his eyes i thought you couldnt cook the inspector said to anne a little later ive learned my husbands cookbook off by heart she confessed his book la traite is even being published in antwerp i would rather go into retraite the guest yawned in the meantime the children were slurping their lemonade and father served out the pasta what is that paul called out eying the strange doughy strands suspiciously its an italian dish son bon appétit he wished everyone pauline began to carefully separate the strands and her brothers followed her lead it is delicious michel praised his kitchen princess it didnt take the children long to discover the possibilities of the silly food and they did a contest to see who could suck up a strand the fastest dont play with your food father berated them and they quickly bit them off they sure listen well antoine commented taking a drink of spring water by the way did you know that bertrand is working on a prestigious project no i didnt did you anne but his wife knew nothing about it either bertrand is going to be digging engineer craponnes canal antoine told he is anne said surprised yes our brother has grown into a big contractor it is a gigantic project that will make him a lot of money even when he was little he was already renovating the house michel remembered the canal is supposed to make la crau fertile his brother continued they have already started digging at the durance and they want the channel to eventually reach all the way to salon but that will take years the maid came in with a crying diana in her arms madam i cant find the pincers anywhere she said nervously theyre in the top drawer of the chest next to the hearth anne said and the maid disappeared michel what do you think about paying your brother a visit his wife asked  i think thats an excellent idea i happen to already have a meeting scheduled with bertrand in saint rémy tomorrow antoine remarked i will tell him youre coming i think it will be interesting to see him at work on his project michel hinted what do you think anne fascinating but it is more than twenty kilometers away and some of those are through very rough terrain we can do it her husband said ask bertrand if he would mind okay i will antoine promised the pot of spaghetti was empty by now and the children went to play in the backyard well id better be going now and antoine said goodbye to everyone father sat down on the veranda to digest his meal and observed his kids from a distance while they were playing with a ball dammit anne suddenly shouted from the kitchen and she ran out into the yard who threw spaghetti up against the ceiling she asked furious paul the children all said startled but the culprit had fled the scene hes going to be in trouble when he gets back mother roared a few days later michel and anne went to la roque on horseback bertrand was digging there with his crew the kids stayed home with the maid after a tough journey through the mountainous northern part of la crau where the river durance flowed they found the excavation site being worked on in full force they tied up their horses and stepped into the building wagon that was parked a few meters from the activities an older man was inside sitting at a desk writing diligently and didnt notice them come in until michel politely coughed my famous brother and his wife bertrand called out excitedly i see youre well on your way too michel said and they gave each other a hug sit down bertrand invited them and got a wooden bench for them how are you doing with your lifes work he asked once they were all seated the prophesies are making good progress his brother answered always reserved when it concerned his work incomprehensible where do you get it all from and how many kilometers are you digging here michel asked twentysix kilometers and a hundred and fifty meters to be exact the building master calculated for them he looked a lot like his brother piercing eyes red cheeks bald head thick beard straight nose their characters however were like day and night you must be thirsty and without waiting for a response bertrand poured three mugs of beer see the canal is going to be right here and he rummaged in his pocket and pulled out a map of the planned project and while his wellread brother seriously absorbed himself in the map bertrand and anne had a cheerful toast cheers to the canal she said flamboyantly one of the workmen came in moments later we found something interesting he reported our archeologist bertrand whispered and they followed him outside to a dug up pile of rubble look various pieces of an old mosaic the worker said and showed them a broken tile that showed part of a snake with an apple in its mouth that must be from roman times bertrand suspected christians dont use that symbol but the kathars do michel said as he stepped closer to the dig while the others were admiring the shards he looked for clues he found something at the bottom of the canal there is a trace of a circular wall he called out and they all came closer to see it probably used to be a well embellished with decorative tiles he continued would you mind if i took that piece with the snake home with me he asked his brother it fascinates me be my guest bertrand shrugged they went back inside where do you know adam de craponne from he lives near us in the city not anywhere near you anne asked after they had filled their beer glasses again the engineer works with all kinds of municipalities that have recommended me bertrand explained he is actually looking for more financing would that be of any interest to you i dont know what do you think anne asked looking at her husband who looked noncommittal i am convinced it would be a good investment bertrand said persuasively aside from the fact that you would be coowner there will be income from the sale of the surrounding land that will be fertilized by irrigation and the profits will be divided among the owners it does sound interesting michel responded cautiously we will consider it when the beer was finished the builder had to get back to work and he promised to pay them a visit in salon the provence with his wife soon when they got home they discussed the attractive investment maybe something to consider for our old age anne suggested when we cant do anything anymore her husband also thought it seemed like a good idea and after weighing the pros and cons they decided to invest the considerable sum of two hundred crowns in the project i still have a lot of work to do darling michel said after that big decision and he retired to his study where he added the broken tile to his collection of relics after that he sorted his writing materials and checked his mail there were two important messages the first one was from his publisher chomarat in lyon he wrote that the king had ordered no less than three hundred copies of the third part of the prophesies henry ii also asked for an accompanying letter for it my book as a relationship present michel grumbled at first the king who sets a good example hasnt been born yet but deep down inside he felt honored well after all rising above the wheel of samsara is no small feat he came around the other envelope was the one he had been waiting for the response from the queen after he broke the seal he tensely read what she had written it seemed catherine was very excited about the horoscope he had sent her with the elaborate character sketch and she asked him to do charts for all seven of her children in the same way unless she heard from him he would get picked up the following thursday there is not even time for a response he determined annoyed after writing an accompanying letter for part three he leaned back in his chair to think no sinecure and another difficult journey he sighed a few minutes later he was telling his wife the good news and his decision he would meet with the offspring of the house of valois in paris the next week he was picked up and he said goodbye to his family again they all waved to him from the front door i think the queen is falling for dad madeleine suggested when the carriage had left but hes not falling for her said césar lets hope not mother said and they all went back into the house the seven little princes were at le louvre an old medieval fort that had been built in the twelfth century to protect the city against attacks from outside but that had been used as a royal residence for the last number of years nostradamus would stay at hôtel des tournelles which was within walking distance of le louvre as soon as he arrived he walked to the colossal fort to meet the royal offspring who were being tutored there daily in all kinds of subjects he would  according to the agreement  spend a day with each of them and that meant that he would leave after one week a secretary welcomed the expected astrologer and immediately took him to the childrens quarters is the queen not here michel asked no sir the royal couple is seldom in paris do you have a preference to which of the children youd like to see first i might as well start with the eldest he said and they entered the room of francis ii the bars in front of the windows showed that this part of the fort had served as a prison in the past the closedoff room was however equipped with all princely amenities the sevenyearold francis was sitting on his bed quietly waiting not a very stimulating environment for a child the scholar thought walking towards the boy say hello to the doctor your highness the secretary commanded sternly francis shook his visitors hand that feels more like a dead fish than a human hand michel thought may i walk freely through le louvre with the prince um yes that would be fine the secretary reluctantly agreed lets go francis lets take a walk michel ordered the boy and a court servant immediately began to follow them i would prefer if we could walk alone the scholar said to him the glorified babysitter hesitated for a moment wondering if he should abandon his duty but then left i will let alert the guards he let him know well francis you sure are living in a gilded cage here michel said when they were alone for the next few hours the two of them wandered through countless rooms with exciting treasures and archives of the french kings from days gone by francis looked healthy and everything was there but mentally he was weak and he didnt have much energy after the elaborate visit the seer returned to his hotel where he got started on francis horoscope right away the next morning he visited the second son sixyearold charles ix who despite the isolated environment was a lot livelier nostradamus got permission to walk through the court gardens with him where tropical birds and wild animals were kept in cages while they were walking past the cages he studied the childs behavior the lad was throwing stones to the animals and then putting his hand through the bars to stroke them his companion had to repeatedly snatch him away this ones not very smart he thought no charles would also not make a good king when they got to the monkey cage they were unexpectedly surprised by a visit from the queen doctor i just had to see you catherine fawned and she suggested the three of them to have a tea ceremony i had just been told that you hardly ever come here michel said as they were walking inside nonsense there are state banquets tournaments and other events here on a regular basis but how is it going with the study its too soon to give you a report your majesty after the short break the queen left them to go and support her husband with the state visit of prince rudolph of habsburg on the fourth day the scholar was taking an early walk around le louvre and looking at the disjointed building structure on which architects builders and decorators had been let loose for centuries maybe ill take the next child outside the gates he thought then hell finally be able to see a bit of the outside world and he walked to the secretary to propose his plan absolutely not the secretary said firmly the safety of the children is paramount but they are languishing here the physician explained at least allow one child to have a look at real life it would be so good for his development the secretary compromised by sending a message to the royal couple who were staying somewhere in paris and an hour later permission was granted michel was sauntering through the streets of paris with henry iii the same day and while they walked they rummaged in the proletarian shops it was visibly good for the boy they larked about until they reached the ile de la cité and then returned via pont neuf too bad but this child is also not a bright light he concluded my findings will not please the queen after the little prince had been safely returned home michel walked to his lodgings in the twilight so far everything had gone well but when he got close to hôtel des tournelles he noticed that someone was following him he decided to confront the man and resolutely turned around startled the man who was wearing a long coat with a high collar quickly disappeared into a dark lane its more dangerous than i thought here michel realized from now on no more little princes outside of the gate the next morning he had a visit with the second youngest child who was only two years old he showed the same characteristics as his brothers and the day passed uneventfully tomorrow the youngest one and then my job is done the astrologer happily thought to himself he was leaving le louvre late that night because he had had permission to nose around in the archives he left the poor lighting of the building behind him and crossed the square to go home it was pitch black and the streets of paris seemed deserted suddenly he noticed three shapes behind him darn that feels sinister he thought stupid of me to walk the streets so late at night by myself and he walked a little faster just past the new pavillon du roi which was still surrounded by scaffolding he darted into a lane to check if he was really being followed the shadowy figures immediately took the same turn the lightfooted scholar was forced to speed up as expected the men behind him began to run after their prey he tried to get rid of them in the confusion of the dark alley ways with his adrenaline pumping michel scrutinized the stone walls corners and fences of the parisian houses but he couldnt find an escape route and hoped for an inspiration but his clairvoyance had abandoned him its beyond my control he decided and looked behind him an instant later they had him he called out for help but all the windows and doors stayed closed the bandits covered his mouth and pushed him into a deadend alley when they pulled out their knives they heard the sound of horse hooves and turned around startled just in time some police officers rode into the lane on horseback and attacked the scoundrels who were now trapped like rats with their sables raised the police attacked and two of them were immediately pierced the third one managed to escape the sword but was soon caught and put in handcuffs while michel breathed a sigh of relief and was about to thank his rescuers a carriage pulled up and a dignitary got out are you unharmed it was morency the police chief who had escorted him earlier your timing couldnt have been better yes im fine the seer said morency brought him to the carriage you made a number of enemies at the court in a very short time he told him thats why the queen has ordered me to keep an eye on you who wants to murder me michel asked i cant tell you many interests of the court are intertwined with each other what i can tell you is that the paris authorities have begun an investigation of your magical practices and therefore i advise you to leave the city as soon as possible but i still have to meet with one more child i think youd better postpone that agreement with the queen because you are really not safe here morency urged him the astrologer decided to finish his job however and got dropped off at the hotel the next day he met with the youngest royal child after which he left paris as quickly as he could the visitor to the royals once again arrived home safe and sound and without another gout attack and there he showed another side of himself not the prophet with a heavy heart but a joyful father who put a mysterious overstuffed suitcase on the table for his family his wife and children looked at it expectantly what is the magician up to anne asked i brought you all something he smiled hocus pocus what is hiding in my bag and he took out a folder with seven sheets of paper with painted handprints of the little de valois princes souvenirs anne exclaimed excitedly and her husband handed the pictures out to everyone be careful with them he instructed because i cant ask the princes to do them again his loved ones were all very pleased and curious they began to compare their royal prints with the others and i have another surprise for you michel said to his wife and he gave her a miniscule pen drawing of le louvre oh its beautiful i will hang it up above the hearth right away she responded lyrically i wouldnt do that if i were you he advised during the following weeks he completed the horoscopes of the seven princes and wrote a letter to the queen saying that her sons would all be kings he didnt add that her offspring were all too weak to rule the country and that the title of king would only be a formality she was smart enough to be able to deduce that from reading the character sketches herself the study was in dire need of a thorough cleaning and the new maid opened the attic window to let in some fresh air nostradamus nervously eyed his instruments and papers he didnt like this another new one he would much rather clean everything up himself but he was getting older and his gout was starting to act up and with her eye on the master the maid cleaned the room are you being careful with my test tubes he asked tersely youre welcome to wait downstairs till im finished doctor she replied irritated he reluctantly decided to do so though not feeling very trusting he began to pace back and forth in the living room and his son césar who was eleven years old by now got the brunt of it put that tinderbox back where it belongs he shouted angrily or your mother wont be able to light the fire and the boy hastily put the object back next to the hearth it took some getting used to giving up control oh the bed he just remembered and he stormed back upstairs before you leave i need you to help me get the bed from the garden house he said while glancing around at his things suspiciously all right the maid squeaked after finishing the cleanup and dragging the piece of furniture up the stairs she left and the scholar was free to get back to work in peace he wanted to use the bed to comfortably get into a trance and he pushed it to where he wanted it just a sheet should be sufficient he thought he lay down and thought about his masterwork during the last few months he had managed to complete two successive centuries together they comprised three actual centuries the history of mankind is truly one big repetition he philosophized getting back up from one nero to the next after every war there is peace and then its another grab for power human will always keep chasing illusions it was getting to be night time and michel sniffed some of the powder that he kept in one of his desk drawers with his mind expanded he opened the attic window to observe the stars through his spyglass the sky was exceptionally clear and he soon discovered a spiral star cluster in spiral star clusters the stars show a strong concentration toward the center in contrast to open star clusters the children were banging relentlessly on the walls below him hey can you guys be a little quieter he called out it got quiet except for a bit of whining but that was tolerable father again peered through his spyglass and observed the nebula which he figured must consist of ten of thousands of stars the stars look as though theyre very close together a voice suddenly spoke out of nowhere but if you travel at the speed of light you need at least a month to go from one star to another michel pushed the spyglass away from his eye in surprise and looked around a small greyhaired man was standing beside him an apparition who are you michel asked i am a physicist the old man answered and he asked if he could have a look through the instrument the spiral nebulas are some of the oldest object known to us the physicist went on looking at the sky oh i didnt know that theyre compact enough to stay stable i know that this star cluster is called omega centauri michel commented omega centauri the old man repeated absentmindedly misleading really that many of these stars are not where we think they are im sorry but i dont understand well the light of the stars bends somewhat when its near other stars which causes a curve in space time the physicist explained but the other scholar still didnt understand a curve in space time time is a relative phenomenon you know when youre sitting next to an attractive woman two hours seems like two minutes but when youre sitting on a bed of hot coals two minutes seems like two hours michel nodded he got that where are you from by the way thats a good question and i have several answers for it the stranger answered but i wont bother you with my views i was born in germany and i later moved to america with my wife in 1955 i died of heart failure and since then i have had the freedom to devote myself to the science of the universe america the land of the indians they have since been wiped out the old man replied i suppose you moved because of the nazi regime exactly the jews were persecuted this time hatred and fear rules anew there are two things that are neverending the universe and human stupidity but im not entirely sure about the universe shortsightedness is runofthe mill too in my time but in the larger scheme of things we are all humans with defects you sure hit the nail on the head there the old man said if only everyone could act from that standpoint but may i ask what your name is michel nostradamus astrologer and physician and whats yours albert einstein but you can just call me albert so youre a famous scientist too thats why we get to meet your telescope is pretty archaic you mean my spyglass yes well ive got to use whatever i can get and michel looked at his instrument a little forlornly ive had the good fortune that in my time technology was more advanced albert resumed and partly because of that ive been able to develop my theories what are your theories well anyone can have the wildest theories of course i always say if the facts dont match the theory change the facts but to answer your question one of the things ive been occupying myself with is how gravity acts at great distances are those complicated theories of any use to the world michel asked albert was quiet for a moment you just hit a sensitive nerve he said suddenly dejected well yes there are developments that benefit society but there is a downside too i should probably have hidden my creativity better he was clearly feeling guilty about something your expression is telling me that you caused something awful to happen well albert sighed i made a huge assessment error which could possibly have fatal consequences for mankind i was afraid of the growing aggressiveness of the germans and thought that the american army needed strengthening so i enabled other scientists to create an atom bomb can you explain to me what that is okay ill keep it simple if you split the smallest part of a chemical element an enormous amount of energy is released an atomic fission of specific atoms even sets off a chain reaction which is absolutely devastating pandoras box yes something like that albert agreed and i suppose some malicious people have run off with your knowledge perhaps i am malicious myself as well i also suffer from narrowmindedness splitting prejudices is even more difficult than splitting atoms well at least you are trying to be righteous yes well unfortunately the bombs have been used several times with disastrous results and that was after i urged the president of the united states not to allow them to explode what are united states um that is part of north america so you didnt really know what kind of damage your research was capable of causing if i knew what it could do it wouldnt be research einstein answered caustically but after the second world war new positions of power were created amongst nations america and russia precicely russia also gained access to atom technology and an arms race between the two superpowers ensued by now both parties have a big enough arsenal of nuclear weapons to destroy the world ten times over on top of that both leaders each have a socalled red button within their reach one push on the button would instantly release all nuclear weapons against each other the more influence you have on life the greater your responsibility michel mused go ahead rub it in as if im not already feeling guilty enough about it but once i had gained a reputation i began to push for worldwide disarmament and equal rights for everyone sadly its been in vain because shortly after my death the united states and the soviet union got into a big dispute over cuba and now they are on the verge of destroying each other and the nuclear scientist nervously twirled his moustache gods ways are unfathomable even if youre clairvoyant michel tried to comfort him but who are the leaders of the superpowers um that would be president roosevelt for the us and stalin for the ussr i was even good friends with roosevelt and no i mean during that conflict after you died oh after me that would be john f kennedy and nikita chroesjtsjov they are the ones who will determine whether there will be a third world war or not and if that happens the fourth world war will be fought with sticks and stones did you meet those two leaders personally well i did get to meet kennedy once in the white house but that was just before he became president at that time i had free access to the white house but i didnt get to know him and i never met the russian commander what is the white house thats the seat of the american government the russian counterpart is the kremlin if you want to i can take you to the white house that unusual offer certainly took nostradamus by surprise and he had to stop and think about the possible consequences for a moment all right if you know the way he finally said my memories are vivid come on lets go albert said cheerful again and pulled his new friend towards the stairs the children were sound asleep on the middle floor and didnt notice anything as the two scientists descended do you have some kind of flying machine or something michel whispered not wanting to wake up his kids we wont need that albert answered quietly they reached the ground floor where anne was looking through a pile of papers by the light of a candle is that you she asked warily yes darling im just going for a walk ill be right back nice wife youve got thanks albert who are you talking to for goodness sake anne who couldnt see the physicist asked a colleague her husband replied she left her dizzy husband alone she knew it was not unusual for him to see ghosts einstein resumed walking with confidence and the other scientist was getting quite curious to see where he was being led to we are going to go down one more set of stairs albert let him know and they went down into the dark cellar where they had to move by touch theres only wine in here the homes owner protested just trust me and one step at the time the two went forward i cant see a thing i should have brought a light michel grumbled but then the cellar suddenly changed into a lit corridor with white walls and someone was coming out of one of the side passages a staff member the nuclear scientist said acting like he was feeling quite at home hello mister einstein the officer greeted him when they passed each other albert stopped him do you know where i can find the president he asked i think he is getting some exercise in the swimming pool you just go straight through and turn left at the end over there and yes thanks i know where it is einstein interrupted him and the two scholars continued on their way they cant see you theyre pretty stupid he said as they turned the corner they soon reached the covered swimming pool where an attendant was cleaning the pool isnt the president here albert asked him no he just left for the oval office and the duo immediately turned around lets take the elevator we need to get to the second floor albert said a mechanical box brought the two scientists upstairs where they got out the nuclear scientist knocked on one of the closed doors and waited for a moment come on in someone called einstein opened the door which gave entrance to an ovalshaped office hi albert here for another visit a man in a wheelchair asked yes theodore i thought it was time for another look i thought you were taking me to see president kennedy michel commented have some patience his colleague hushed and they looked around the beautiful office while theodore remained silent it was as if he was switched off how come this office is oval anyway michel asked because that way you can look everyone in the eyes during a conference albert answered youre a funny one no seriously look theres kennedy the man in the wheelchair had flown on to other realms and in his place now stood a handsome middleaged man michel waved his hand right in front of the new presidents face but there was no reaction he cant see me either albert indicated kennedy looked pale and had dark circles under his eyes he usually has enormous charisma the nuclear scientist resumed alluding to the seriousness of the situation max youre just who i need to see the president suddenly said to nostradamus catching him by surprise max is his personal physician albert explained this role is made for you made for me just play along and good luck and einstein disappeared into thin air come now i get to do his dirty work michel complained but he shook the presidents hand max youve got to help me stay on my feet my back is bothering me so much his excellency continued his voice sounded tired and he sat down gloomily on a couch in the center of the office michel sat down beside him to lend him an ear i need more of those pills max theyre all demanding the utmost of me russia is placing more and more nuclear missiles in cuba the situation is getting out of hand um i dont have any pills the medieval man stammered an injections okay too man that damn corset is crooked again nostradamus was inadvertently drawing him out and the president aired his heart some more chroesjtsjov is walking all over me that russian sees me as a weak leader its probably true too i havent been taking a strong enough position in a number of important issues his communist allies also think im a weakling and his head dropped down to his chest in a gesture of defeat give me something max ive got to keep going he begged again we cant just accept nuclear missiles that are pointed at the united states from so close by ive sent all the diplomats to the russian commander to convince him of this but to no avail kennedy stared ahead with a vacant expression and suddenly collapsed the big couch caught him and he lay on it motionlessly near the desk there was a beeping sound and michel walked up to it to investigate mister president a voice announced from a loudspeaker chroesjtsjov on the line for you he listened attentively hello mister kennedy you are worried about our defense arms at more than ninety miles from the coast of america then id like to point out to you that your offense weapons have been set up in turkey pointing at our territory the seer let out a big sigh or is it your opinion the russian continued that it is your exclusive right to demand safety for your country im not who you think you are michel said but his words were ignored i therefore propose the following chroesjtsjov spoke unreachable we are prepared to remove our missiles from cuba and make a promise to the united nations then you must remove your weapons from turkey and make a similar promise do you agree suddenly there was a knock on the door of the oval office and startled the scholar caused a magnetic disruption in the control panel and broke off the connection with the russian vice president johnson and other top officials entered the office they were visibly shocked when they saw their leader lying lifelessly on the couch and rushed to his side hes alive johnson said relieved while he checked his heart beat hes collapsed a few times during the past few weeks one of the ministers said glumly ill call max jacobson the general offered are you sure thats a good idea johnson asked you know what they call him in parliament doctor feelgood yes but the president doesnt want anyone else the general said and they decided theyd better alert jacobson who was staying in the west wing kennedys personal physician soon came rushing in and examined his boss he has fainted due to a shortage of the required substances he quickly diagnosed he rolled up the presidents sleeve and gave him an injection sure enough nostradamus saw with surprise that as soon as the substance had been administered john f kennedy slowly but surely came to thank you max you sure know how to support me through thick and thin his boss mumbled while he sat up with some difficulty mister president we dont want to disturb you unnecessarily the general said nervously but we have extremely important news okay go ahead john answered still feeling a bit dull well it is clearly visible on the new photos that the russian missiles are still being placed on cuba the entire army top is of the opinion that we should teach the russians a lesson and proceed with an attack a staff member appeared at the door mister president the employee called mister sukarno is here may i send him in kennedy agreed and hastily spoke to his colleagues there is one mediator left who i think stands a chance of succeeding and that is the president of the indonesian republic he is in close contact with the russian commander sukarno came in and the americans welcomed him please sit down kennedy requested but sukarno declined and began to speak agitatedly after the incident with your airplane the b25 i am suspecting the american government of wanting to cause my downfall and because i strongly suspect that this room is bugged i request the president to allow our discussion to take place in his bedroom the general took his boss aside our intelligence is warning against a possible assassination attempt on you he whispered in my bedroom and by him no and anyway i dont want to lose my freedom kennedy decided and left the office with sukarno michel followed the two presidents who took the elevator to a higher floor once they had arrived there the two leaders resumed walking but their pursuer forgot to jump out of the box in time the elevator doors closed too quickly and he was brought down to the basement where the doors opened automatically not knowing how to operate this transportation device he got out and came to the same corridor with the red carpet i think id better get home michel thought ive seen enough he took the same route back and it soon got dark again after a while he saw a light in the distance which turned out to be his own cellar stairs he stumbled up the stairs feeling quite depressed is that you anne asked still holding papers in her hands silently he padded towards his wife and sat down with her at the table wheres your colleague she teased while looking at pictures of herbs turned inward he put his elbows on the table and sighed are you okay she continued anne sometimes i think im going mad he said finally what happened the world in the future is about to explode its all getting to be just too much for me come here she asked and he knelt next to her and put his head on her lap anne gently stroked his last few strands of hair i just feel so responsible for the fate of the human race he complained my lifes path runs right through hell youre special she said trying to encourage him anne from now on dont open to door to all those wretched souls who are constantly asking for help okay its all just too much for me these days all right i wont but lets get some sleep now tomorrow is a new day and they went to bed michels depression was the beginning of a new gout attack it was a big one and he had to stay in bed for a month his wife answered all his mail for him requests for reading horoscopes or for advice about illnesses from people everywhere once in a while there was an argumentative challenge from a scientist about some controversial topic and she just ignored those ones for the most part it was sufficient to send a standard message in french saying that the doctor was not able to personally answer the letter due to special circumstances ill find a clerk soon to take care of my correspondence her husband promised lying in bed in a lot of pain yes we certainly do need one anne agreed she was getting exhausted too andré and diane came in and started jumping on the bed you guys you leave your sick father alone mother ordered testily and she closed the curtains to separate the area from the rest of the room im sorry youre having such a hard time because of me her husband apologized dont worry everything will be all right anne said as she sat down at the side of his bed but something strange is going on that big bag of nutmeg is already all gone again he didnt respond to that and turned away from her feigning pain hey i dont appreciate that i want to know what you do with it she asserted sincerely but he wouldnt answer whats the big mystery i just use it for certain experiments he answered indefinitely but she wanted to know exactly what he did with it he did not want to tell her finally he gave in okay i inhale it he confessed why on earth would you do that i inhale it because it stimulates my sense of imagination anne suddenly turned to ice i refuse to work for an addict she said resolutely an addict michel reacted like a hurt puppy and he turned to face her this last drop makes the bucket overflow she continued darling what are you talking about and he tried to sit up groaning were all walking on eggshells for you in this house i thought you said everything was fine yes thats what you thought but its not true you see and feel everything except your own family everything is about you and now this he let her blow off some steam and that infernal control of yours she accused him you never let yourself go it would be better if you hit me once in while and she mockingly pushed him back into bed temper yourself a bit please youll scare the kids theyre always scared already she yelled just to make sure they could hear it he realized he couldnt say anything right so he didnt say anything we also never have normal sex she rattled on i thought jews were good in bed but you seem more like a statue of a saint i wish youd have a normal orgasm once in while like normal man and she walked away furious michel crawled out of bed and limped after her oh so his holiness can walk all of a sudden so ive been killing myself for a pretender i never want to see you again and she stormed down the stairs and slammed the door so hard that the whole house shook shes right im addicted he thought i want to see images of the future too much and thats why ive maybe become insensitive ill stay away from it from now on and he crawled back under the woolen blankets the fight raged on and on and nostradamus was forced to answer his letters himself his usually lively wife refused to do anything for him anymore in fact she refused to do anything at all fortunately the kids were old enough to fend for themselves still reeling from his gout attack he wrote a letter to jean dorat one of his admirers in paris perhaps the renowned scholastics teacher had a good student who would be able to assist him his wife meanwhile had retreated to the garden house and the spouses avoided each other for weeks until one night there was a banging on the front door another one of those desperados the healing scholar thought shuffling towards the entrance leave me alone he called out but the racket continued and he begrudgingly opened the door is there something wrong with your ears or what and he looked intently at the supposed needy person standing in the doorway good heavens it cant be true the ghost of françois rabelais his study friend from the olden days had appeared before him by jupiter the devil is playing tricks on me michel swore calm down man calm down its really me françois said soothingly i thought you would have sensed i was on my way but apparently you didnt did i come at a bad time um no of course not or maybe you did im kind of in the middle of a marital crisis but come in and they hugged maybe im here to help you françois suggested while they walked to the living room they sat down near the fire place what are you doing here michel asked i thought you were the court physician of the viceroy of piemonte yes i was but now i work for the pope in avignon where is your wife shes in the garden house he answered dejectedly any kids yes six of them theyre all asleep im very thirsty do you have something to drink françois asked and his old study friend went to the kitchen when he returned with some beer rabelais had suddenly disappeared have i really lost my mind after all he asked himself in all seriousness but then he heard an unfamiliar noise in the garden and realized that he had not been hallucinating françois was trying to convince his wife to come out of the garden house so my husband has sent me a mediator anne sneered when a stranger entered her living space no no youre wrong i had a premonition that my friend was in trouble and i spontaneously decided to pay him a visit ha another clairvoyant she said scornfully you are speaking to the ambassador of the pope you know i dont care if youre the pope himself you arrogant oaf and she pushed him out of the garden house where did you find such a wife françois asked his ears burning when he got back to the living room found her amongst a herd of wild horses michel grumbled is that one of those obscure lines from your verses but the astrologer shook his head well that explains a lot but let me see you we havent seen each other in ages and they looked at each other youve still got a full head of hair michel said yes its still growing every day and you look fantastic for your age thanks your eyes and tongue are as sharp as ever heres your beer and they sat down by the fire again hard to imagine you of all people a freethinking cathar working for the pope michel continued and why not your friend is your enemy though i fully support pope pius iv he is a spiritual leader with a lot of integrity and the bad stuff is happening only at the lower levels what kind of spiritual position do you have the pope has me secretly inspecting the inquisitors and bishops to see if theyre applying the teachings in a pure way goodness gracious right in the lions lair yes life must be lived on the cutting edge françois answered i agree with you on that so are you living the life of a celibate too certainly if i had chosen to have a family i would have to pick a different profession but im sure you have your enemies too anne unexpectedly came in and the men looked at her curiously trying to gauge her mood im sorry i was so rude to you she apologized never mind dont worry about it why dont you sit down with us the uninvited guest requested and she grabbed a chair françois is an old study friend of mine because of my years of wandering we lost track of each other michel explained bashfully but anne wouldnt give her husband the time of day and only looked at the spiritual visitor so this is the wife who has to offer resistance to the grand master rabelais provoked her grand master she repeated indignantly last week he got his beard stuck in the front door while locking it every passerby had ample opportunity to give him a spanking françois had to laugh so exuberantly at this it was almost scary your husband is a genius when it comes to the inner life of humans but on earth he can sometimes be a klutz just like anyone else he said recovering from the hilarity anne however was not convinced i know he is famous everywhere because of his publications she acknowledged but im not so sure about his greatness a year ago he mistook the mayor for a ghost and bumped right into him françois had to laugh again how can i explain it help me out here michel i just try to leave things alone as much as i can he answered vaguely he always shrouds himself in mystery and never tells me anything about his inner world hes just like an oyster she added yes your husband is indeed reticent and my tongue is very loose in comparison but you know speaking is silver but silence is golden but anne was not impressed good and evil are united in each person françois continued his argument and there is no one who knows this better than your husband well i know that i often show my anger he never does if your husband were to show his anger it could destroy the world thats why he must be extremely careful with both words and deeds it is a matter of awareness and your husband has been given an unprecedented powerful amount of that you mean if michel were to get mad at me it could really harm me the average person could drop dead in a fight with him or get seriously ill but you are a strong woman who can take a lot you are plato plato youre comparing me to that greek philosopher besides being the name of a philosopher plato is also the greek word for broadshouldered michel interrupted oh i get it im strong enough to be able to take on my husband and finally there was a spark of contact between the two spouses again yes certainly but this is especially because he knows how to control his senses with the utmost selfdiscipline because the bigger the mind the bigger the beast rabelais said wisely you certainly praise my husband highly she said still suspicious but if im not mistaken youre saying he has to be especially careful to never lose control exactly he really cant afford to even an unguarded train of thought could have disastrous results you see thoughts are powers can you explain that okay take that chair youre sitting on for example it didnt just spring into existence first there has to be a thought or a mental image of a chair and that is then followed by matter in the case of the chair this is the wood in the hands of the carpenter hmm that sounds kind of like a prediction coming true she compared just see michel your wife has occult knowledge if he had shared his knowledge with me sooner we wouldnt be having this crisis yes it might be a good idea to communicate more with your wife françois said to his friend im starting to see the truth of that michel admitted the marriage crisis was coming to an end and they celebrated with a beer its time for me to leave you now my friends françois finally announced youre welcome to stay here anne offered thank you i appreciate your hospitality but ive already made arrangements to stay at the swan before you leave theres something id like to show you michel said okay but first ill visit your washroom françois said and the seer went ahead to his work room when anne was showing the guest where the bathroom was he whispered something in her ear anne your husband is very nearly enlightened try to let go of him in your heart only the individual soul can transcend and god loves him and without waiting for a response he walked away the weighty words slowly penetrated and she finally understood that she had an important task to fulfill in the attic michel was waiting to show his friend the broken tile with the snake you might know what this is he said when he got there jesus a part of the mosaic of magdalene of montségur françois exclaimed in surprise and he carefully picked up the ageold tile thats not where it came from though it came from la roque near the durance well in any case take good care of it but i have to go now and he put the tile back the two men embraced like brothers be careful dont get yourself murdered michel warned him when they were walking down the stairs and you watch you dont crash down off your jacobs ladder his friend replied cheerfully when they got to the bottom of the stairs he said goodbye to anne at the front door the men exchanged a few more words thanks for everything françois and lets keep in touch yes thats what you promised forty years ago too his guardian angel answered as he took his leave incorrigible that rabelais michel smiled with a hint of sadness as he watched him walk away the next day one christophe de chavigny arrived at the station of salon de provence he asked around for the house of the prophet his request was granted right away there were many who wanted to accompany the young man from paris hoping to catch a glimpse of their mythical townsman the cum laude student of jean dorat was eager to develop himself under the tutelage of the grand master and it was the butcher who dropped him off in front of the door with his cart with a bag of lamb chops in his hand the snubnosed student presented himself aha my savior from paris nostradamus welcomed him and because the house was apparently too small he sent his helper minus lamb chops to an inn to spend the night first ill check out what kind of guy were dealing with here michel thought eyeing the bag of meat christophe turned out to be a true disciple he didnt need one extra word of instruction he was quick as lightning in understanding what his master wanted from him he carried out his tasks with such incredible dedication that it overwhelmed his boss at times the young parisian was also familiar with all the latest philosophical trends including rational thinking and was just as proficient in the classical languages anne meanwhile had arranged for a new desk for the clerk and had her husbands moved into the living room after a month the scholar had to acknowledge that de chavignys presence was a blessing for him my correspondence has never been so up to date he observed happily he was starting to get old now and had been worried that he would not be able to complete the prophesies but now he had enough time to be able to tend to it he had already trained himself in the past to only need four or five hours of sleep at night but that was primarily because an awake state was the best way to travel to the other side that night the penpusher had blessedly gone to his own place a few streets away and the children were all asleep just to be on the safe side the master locked the door of his room i think ill change to a different technique he said to himself and he went and got the copper stool the stool with the legs that were the same angle as the incline on the sides of the pyramids in egypt im staying away from the nutmeg and hallucinogenic oils from now on he determined i cant let myself go mad and he started to hum next to the stool no thats not working he mumbled and decided to try the meditation bed in the middle of the night the explorer of the skies found himself flying over a modern city where horseless carriages with lamps on their heads and tails were driving around he descended to have a closer look at this marvel and started wandering around the streets and squares which were lit up lavishly after a little while a mighty building appeared up ahead which he thought he recognized this must be the parliament buildings under which hister committed suicide he suspected his suspicion was confirmed by a monument in front of it berlin had recovered admirably from the enormously destructive war violence that had left behind huge piles of rubble back then a river ran diagonally across the lit up city and he decided to follow the flowing water which brought him to a church yard where someone was trudging along the waters edge a neglectedlooking man was pushing a cart loaded up with junk dead end michel thought and let it be he rose again turned a sharp corner and flew back to the potsdamer platz flying like a bird is a true joy he decided and like a young god he spread his wings on the grand square stood a stately archway with a greek chariot on top of it and he boldly flew through it when he had passed the gateway he bumped right into some kind of electrical field and the punch of it caused him to tumble down to the ground pride always come before the fall he rebuked himself for his frivolous behavior and feeling a bit dazed he tried to figure out what had happened to him he carefully examined the space but he couldnt see anything the fallen ghost got up and tested his flying skills good thats still intact he thought relieved but what did i bump into curious he moved towards the place where it had happened and looked all around the area surrounding it theres got to be something he mumbled and unexpectedly his hand touched a voltage field and made a blue surface appear holy cow the future is full of surprises and carefully he walked along the magnetic field which kept shorting out every time he touched it it seemed to be an invisible wall which divided the city into two sections it was a mystery to him what purpose it served but he really wanted to know the people who lived here must know more about this and with fresh impetus he started to hunt down a random passerby from high above the city he noticed the same hobo with his cart and because he was the only sign of life around he dove towards him hey you he called out but the berliner with his crooked hat didnt hear him and just sauntered on the ghost now landed right in front of him but the man just kept walking undisturbed he cant see or hear me michel understood and deliberated how to get his attention he had to hit the right nerve hey napoleon he tried that hit the target right away because the tramp stopped abruptly friend or foe he wanted to know friend wow finally a fellow countryman what is your rank the poor devil asked he must have lost some of his marbles field marshal michel played along didnt i order you to attack russia yes but moscow has been captured in the meantime excellent that frees me to deal with cartload of stuff here and he resumed walking do you happen to know why that electrical wall runs through berlin the marshal intervened are you crazy or what there used to be wall it was made of stone but my brave men tore it down not long ago i still have a picture of it and he pulled a newspaper article out of his inside coat pocket the seer looked at the photo of the dividing wall being demolished and read the text under it fall of the berlin wall1989 it has now been exactly two years since the iron curtain the division between east and west fell a united germany will commemorate the fall en masse today with concerts and discussions among other things the wall was intended to stop the flow of fugitives who were migrating to the free west so thats why theres a magnetic field running through the city he understood years of frustration must have given the wall a psychic charge where are those men of yours he then asked i dont know where they are theyve exiled me but i can show you where they hang out okay show me the place michel requested he wanted to find out how the conflict had been resolved with the tramp pushing his cart again the two started on their way to the eastern part of the city after they had crossed the alexanderplatz the man stopped in front of a large ungainly building this is it the old police station where i used to be in charge you can go in and ask your questions yes i will the seer said he gave him a franc and then walked towards the entrance nay pau leon more fire than blood the tramp called after him michel turned around in surprise when he heard the line from his own verse in the wrong order but the man was looking the other way and a little further on he moodily kicked a streetlight which immediately went out wow amazing my verses are going to be popular in the future and feeling pleased the seer entered the dilapidated building beyond the entrance was a gloomylooking room with no one in it and he decided to go up the marble staircase where are those brave guys he was talking about upstairs there was some hope because he saw a few men who were busy doing something they turned out to be just civil servants though he went back downstairs and just as he was about to leave the vestibule he heard a loud sound indicating activity coming from the big room what on earth is happening in there and curious he stepped into the room which was suddenly filled with a large crowd i must have spontaneously moved several years back in time he speculated he blended in with the crowd and keeping his ears wide open it was a press conference and hundreds of journalists had gathered to see the topmost party leaders of the communist state whats going on he asked a reporter who thought he was a foreign colleague weve never been allowed to ask questions directly the east german answered fiddling with the flash on his camera but it seems that this time schabowski is bowing to pressure of the people to make an exception the party is hoping to win back the support of the people through more openness what if they dont succeed if they dont succeed our country will simply empty out regardless of miles of walls and fences and he excused himself to wrestle his way to the front meanwhile his colleagues were asking all kinds of questions but as always they just got a standard response until a french journalist addressed the core issue in broken german when will your fellow countrymen be free to travel to the west he asked simply the reporters barely took his question seriously because they fully expected schabowski to find some elaborate way to talk his way around it without really answering it anyway but in the face of the international crowd the party leader suddenly felt like he was on trial and he clammed up how can i go on telling all those lies he worried and breaking out into a cold sweat he unexpectedly began to open up today um as far as i am aware a decision has been made and um we have decided  that ultimately every citizen will be allowed to cross the border the crowd was dumbstruck when will this new rule go into effect a journalist immediately asked schabowski shuffled his papers a bit and then looked at his staff members who had no idea what to do either um as far as i know it will go into effect  as of this moment because the press conference seemed so clumsy everyone doubted if this was really true until someone ran outside and shouted out loudly the border is open the news spread through the city like wildfire and soon the east berliners streamed to the wall en masse to check and see if they could really get into westberlin nostradamus floated along behind them amazing what one silly little question from my side can instigate he thought from now on i really must let destiny take its own course the wall turned out to be still locked and thousands of people besieged the border guards in a peaceful way they were suddenly surrounded by a horde of reporters am i to understand that the wall has to be opened today the head of the guard stammered yes on the order of schabowski everyone chanted the officer waited for a while to see if he would receive formal instructions but then succumbed to the enormous pressure and opened the border crossings fortunately the red army did not intervene overwhelmed the eastberliners walked to the other side of the border where they were met by westberliners flocking towards them and welcoming them with loud applause the seer happily looked on as total strangers embraced each other underneath the brandenburger tor and burst into tears of happiness and disbelief the berlin monument with the greek chariot had been standing in no mans land for so many years and some people were moved to touch its cold pillars one of the city dwellers was parading under the gateway like a madman and filled with emotion kept calling out ich bin ein berliner isnt that the man from the white house michel thought but he couldnt be more wrong it was the future tramp who thought he was napoleon the man who at this point had not yet deteriorated suddenly began to kiss everyone and the seer also got a big smacker the border was now definitely open and several strong men had already started to demolish the wall souvenir for sale one of them joked with a chunk of the wall in his hand the french spectator then left the national festival and cheerfully returned to the renaissance finally a happy ending he thought when he returned to his body id like that to happen more often and jumped down from the bed it was the dead of night and he crept down the stairs on his tip toes to the bedroom anne he whispered are you asleep yes im sleeping but come on into bed and he carefully lay down beside her and went to sleep a new day dawned and the wind blew fresh air in through the open windows wellrested the scholar went downstairs and found his wife ironing in the living room youre up late anne said while a cloud of steam rose from the ironing board no guests today isnt that the maids job shes been sick for two days oh i didnt notice her husband mumbled leaning against the sewing basket i have a lot of paperwork i have to do with christophe today but id like to go for an all day walk with you tomorrow he proposed i can only go the day after tomorrow because tomorrow my sister is coming over for a visit okay its a date he said playing with the thimble do you want jacqueline to sew another robe for you she asked yes that would be great but not a black one brown would be good why dont you tell her yourself shell like that all right i will by the way i had an amazing experience last night michel said trying to involve her a bit more into the world of his experiences it was a kind of jericho except it was in germany ah the walls that are crumbled by religion anne knew and she placed the iron up on its stand yes but not by a belief in god but by a belief in freedom that sounds good to me and she started to iron the next piece of clothing while he held the seams tight for her i like it when you tell me about your other life she said suddenly shy and for the first time ever he saw her blush christophe came down from the attic master count ercole from florence has still not received your recommendations im afraid the translations have been lost in the mail do you want me to prepare new ones no just write him that he has to search more carefully in his administration that shifty character is just trying to avoid my fee and both men started to walk up the stairs while talking after jacquelines visit anne and michel jumped out of bed early the next day and took a picnic basket full of treats to the nearby fields and forests after spending a very pleasant day together the couple happily returned home with their basket filled with herbs and flowers when they were nearing their home they were approached by the priest who was hurrying towards them doctor have you heard the bad news already no but i have some idea of what it could be pray tell the king is dead the priest said looking sad he had an accident with one of his captains but vanity was his guiding principle michel thought you have a special bond with the royal house doctor the priest continued and thats why i want to offer you my condolences thank you very much reverend this is a sad day for all of france and they continued their walk home a crowd of people had gathered in front of their house and when the mystic and his wife arrived they all expressed their sympathy the next day the death of henry ii was legally proclaimed and that afternoon an escorted carriage stopped in front of the de nostredame home while the governor of provence got out the towns people flocked to see him christophe opened the front door and as quick as a whip he informed his master nostradamus came out from behind his desk and invited his friend the governor to take a seat on the porch you know about the death of the king of course claude de tende assumed as he sat down at the outdoor table the scholar nodded a lance pierced his golden helmet and went right through his eye and throat two wounds in one during a practice duel the governor informed him but aside from the horror of it and the fact that we will all miss him the unity of france is now in danger oh i dont think we have to worry about that his host opined while a drop of rain splashed on his face lets hope not you had already predicted the kings death in your last almanac catherine de medici personally told me about that for years i only considered your work a nice bit of entertainment but now your predictions are being eerily confirmed do you have any idea what kind of power you could have i am only too aware of that and feel very responsible so why didnt you warn henry ii the king didnt want to have anything to do with astrology michel calmly explained the governor sighed deeply and was clearly affected by the death which could even have consequences for his own position marguerite de valois the kings sister would like to come and see you for a consultation she will contact you soon he resumed she is most welcome i will be happy to serve her the scholar promised claude stared straight ahead looking melancholy whos going to lead france now he asked the princes are too young and much too inexperienced the queen will rule the country she has already been educating herself in the current affairs of the state the scholar answered confidently while stroking his beard the governor looked at him in awe realizing that this fellow countryman was someone of very high caliber the maid came out onto the porch and served tea and the men talked a bit more a few days later christophe came in with the expected royal letter fantastic news master he revealed and michel quickly skimmed it the kings sister wrote that she was planning to come and see him right after her brothers funeral and hoped that it would not be an inconvenient time for him one mans death is another mans living he thought sadly shaking his head christophe when the time comes wear something nice and he gave his student a golden ducat that friday a royal carriage arrived at the narrow place de la poissonnerie and some guards kept the curious commoners at bay marguerite de valois swept into the seers home dressed in mourning clothes complete with a black veil his children were on their best behavior waiting in the entrance hall only paul was absent he was busy chasing girls they all nodded politely and feasted their eyes on her opulent garment michel and anne accompanied her highness to the living room which had been spruced up for the royal visit christophe made a brief appearance by poking his head in for a minute anne offered her condolences to the kings sister and then left the room to give her and her husband some privacy after a short talk marguerite thanked him for his advice to stay out of politics from now on and to go and spend some time on the seashore to regain her strength the royal procession continued on its way and peace and quiet returned to the square one summer evening diane couldnt get to sleep and anne told the youngest child a fairytale her husband happened to be just coming down from the attic and heard how she handled her veiled lifes lesson once there was an evil sorcerer who uttered a curse she began is that about me he called from the stairs if the shoe fits wear it she answered i wonder whats eating her today he wondered and continued on his way to the living room where he had a chat with the maid after he had watered the plants in the garden he decided to go to bed early the next day he finished part six of the prophesies and immediately took the manuscript to the post office to send it to his publisher in lyon christophe usually took care of these kinds of things but michel felt like getting a bit of exercise it was quiet in the street so he figured no one would be bothering him after dropping off his package he was walking past his statue in the city square when he saw a number of young guys shooting arrows at his image ive never had much understanding of mischief he thought disgruntled but wait a minute isnt that my own son paul he even looked like he was the instigator of the group and he felt like he should admonish him but changed his mind oh well never mind ill save it for something important its just a dumb statue long live transience a city guard had just come around the corner too and he saw the rascals desecrating the citys figurehead hey you come here he loudly commanded but the kids took off very fast when he saw nostradamus he apologized ill get that riff raff sir they wont escape me that easily oh dont worry about it it doesnt really bother me the honored citizen smoothed the incident over he would rather not have his own son exposed in a bad light and continued walking after a few minutes he was overcome by an oppressive feeling and he rested for a moment that did not feel natural he thought a bit upset but it subsided so he continued on his way but after a while the horrible feeling returned and he had to stop to recover from it again now every time he moved he was attacked by an uncontrollable force i should have known he thought the harrowing of hell is manifesting by daylight and he decided to go home where he was in a better position to protect himself from supernatural evil on the way back he was constantly being besieged from the other world and the battle was taking all of his strength he repeatedly had to stop and passersby were looking at their stumbling fellow townsman who was usually so spry despite his advanced age he kept on staggering and heard someone ask can i help you several times but the silent force was so intense and dark that he was unable to respond and suddenly his knees buckled and he fell down several people rushed up to the medium to help him and carried him home anne and christophe alarmed took over from there and dragged him up the stairs to his bed once there michel began to have seizures as anne sat by his side feeling scared her husband looked like he was losing his sanity he was defending himself from ghosts and kept yelling mouthwash three times a day he calmed down for a moment and she quickly tried to make contact whats happening to you she asked in a panic somebody wants to kill me he answered listlessly he was as white as ghost the usual blush on his cheeks had all but disappeared and when a heavy attack followed he lost consciousness his spirit landed on one of the terraces of purgatory and fell into the hands of evil in the dark laboratory stood a table full of test tubes glass bowls measuring cups and bottles and nostradamus was just finishing a dark experiment several potions were boiling above a fire and rising vapors concealed his face abracadabra any time now there will be gold and everyone will be at my mercy he laughed uproariously excited he trickled the last bit of alchemical substance into the liberally filled flask and added some more alcohol just to be on the safe side then he brought the liquid with the crumbled lead to a boil after which he distilled the mixture into solid and volatile components now a bit of gunpowder he snickered while he searched inside a cabinet he returned to the bubbling liquids with a glass cylinder in his hand the power will not escape me this time suddenly the door to the shed burst open which startled him and he dropped the glass cylinder smashing it into smithereens he looked straight into the barrel of some terrible weapon kill the sorcerer a mechanical voice spoke coming out of nowhere the alchemist instinctively dove to the side and the table and all the glass instruments were completely shot to pieces by a gigantic bullet my superexpensive laboratory completely ruined you jerk whoever you are but he swallowed his words because the barrel of the weapon was pointed at him again right at the last second some muscled guards came to his rescue from outside destroy the intruder men he commanded but the guards were killed one by one and he had to leave the room to save his life bunch of idiots the scholar sneered as he fled down a corridor lit by burning torches bang a bullet flew along the walls the stranger was right on his heels and fired again just in the nick of time nostradamus was able to dash into a room where monks in grey dresses were meditating let them take the brunt of it he thought heartlessly as he mingled in with them a moment later his attacker had destroyed all the servants of god who were in his way the scholar meantime roamed through the underground complex and ended up in a grand library which was lit up by countless fires he hurriedly bolted the heavy wooden entrance door behind him hell never get in here he thought with conviction and relaxed as he walked towards the shelves full of ageold books the valuable manuscripts were useless now that he had the golden formula just then the entrance door was shattered with one shot and he flew past the rows of bookcases to hide his pursuer however was unstoppable and shot everything to shreds a fire started and in the chaos nostradamus managed to escape through a trap door he landed in a cavelike tunnel and quickly walked through it a little further on he stopped to listen whether the creep was still following him fortunately he heard nothing that problem is solved he thought im safe and after some time he reached an underground lake but suddenly the horrible weapon appeared again and was pointed directly at him surprisingly some bats tried to protect him this time with distraction manoeuvers but they all got shot to death the alchemist shrugged his shoulders dove into the lake and quickly swam away he stayed under water as long as possible because every time he came up for air bullets were flying everywhere with more luck than smarts he managed to reach the other side of the wide lake where he triumphantly pulled himself up on the rocks then suddenly he was shot and he collapsed want to play another game the mechanical voice asked yes but first i need a minute to recuperate someone replied whats my score 1566 points in the dark laboratory stood a table full of test tubes and measuring cups nostradamus was behind it on the verge of inventing something great various potions were boiling above a fire while rising vapors obscured his face the queen will be happy he rejoiced and carefully he trickled some vitriol into the flask and added some alcohol when the liquid with the crumbled lead had reached the boiling point he caught the distillation into some longnecked bottles hmm still not looking quite right he driveled and rummaged in a cabinet behind him for some additives suddenly the door to the shed burst open and startled he dropped the glass jar on the floor where it smashed to smithereens he looked straight into the barrel of a terrible weapon kill the sorcerer a mechanical voice sounded by reflex michel jumped aside and the table along with all the glass equipment was wiped out in one shot my last hour has arrived he thought but some guards unexpectedly rushed in to try to protect him they were all destroyed in a matter of minutes however right before his eyes and in great distress he recognized one of the victims grandpa is done for he moaned while he crawled towards him jean was lying on the floor dead as a doornail after his attempt to save his grandson he didnt have a lot of time to think about it because the weapon was once again pointing at him like a bat out of hell he fled the laboratory and ran down an endless corridor the phantom thundered after him shooting the whole time still alive the alchemist managed to get into another room where some family members were chatting not suspecting anything yolande victor get out of here he shouted but they were instantly destroyed by the rising ghost in the blink of an eye shaky nostradamus ran on and ended up in an ageold library where he hurriedly locked the entrance door behind him panting he tried to catch his breath i have a great book for you someone suddenly said abigail we dont have much time he answered in a panic it never pays to rush the bookseller said in a soothing voice and pulled him towards the treasures of knowledge abigail listen to me we really must get out of here immediately but his words were rudely interrupted the lock was shot off the door and shattered into a million pieces the phantom entered and thought he had his prey in the trap he immediately wiped out abigail however michel flew off and hid behind the bookcases then the whole library was shot to smithereens and the unique manuscripts disappeared in a sea of fire thanks to the chaos the scholar managed to escape through a trapdoor and he landed in an underground corridor where lighting was indispensable a good thing i brought a candle he murmured digging into his bag isabelle hang on just a little longer well get there with a light in his hand and his daughter on his back he strode through the tunnel behind him was a sudden sound good god does everything have to go wrong today he lamented and hurried on the phantom meanwhile had entered the cave structure with his bloodthirsty hounds and the barking sounded fierce the rattled pair soon reached an underground lake where michel hesitated there was nowhere to go the demon had caught up to them by then and again pointed his weapon at them isabelle take a big breath father ordered but before he had a chance to dive into the water a direct hit put an end to his attempted escape do you want to play another game the mechanical voice asked again yes but lets go to the next level in the dark laboratory nostradamus stood at a table covered in test tubes he was working on a unique experiment to make gold is like the purification of body and spirit he was saying to himself then he poured a bit of saltpeter into the boiling brew which had an unexpectedly intense reaction a large tongue of fire scorched his beard and brought him out his reverie abracadabra i am creating by speaking but look at this hodgepodge here on the table he suddenly thought with perfect clarity someone is playing a game with me and he looked around the room this is not my work room he quickly determined suddenly the door to the shed burst open and he was looking into the barrel of a terrible weapon a denizen from hell he stuttered utterly bewildered kill the sorcerer a voice out of nowhere commanded the awakened alchemist dove aside and rolled out of the laboratory while the glass instruments were being shot to smithereens how do i get out of this realm he wondered in agony but no bright ideas came to him so he broke into a run after he had run down several corridors the denizen from hell caught up to him michel managed to hide in an ageold library just in the nick of time and firmly pushed the bolts across the gateway behind him a moment of respite he sighed and while he caught his breath he explored his surroundings the gigantic room appeared to hold an overwhelming number of books the akashic records the library of all times the solution must be right here and he hurried over to the documents he picked up the first book from the bookcase which had the words the elixir of bliss by alghazali written on the front in illuminated lettering the muslim on the island of sicily he immediately remembered and he hurriedly started to leaf through the mystical book the first passage made reference to the seven valleys of the soul and searching for the right clue he continually kept his eye on the entrance gate trial thunder abyss hymn religious celebration thats not very helpful he complained let me find it quick there was a clattering sound the denizen from hell was fiddling with the door penance blockages curses thats what im looking for then the wooden door was smashed into a thousands pieces by an enormous force of fire and he dropped the book out of his hands by jupiter stand still or ill shoot the scholar implored pointing his right index and middle fingers at the danger the resident of hell froze visibly and michel moved towards him stiff with tension when he got close to him he peered along the barrel of the weapon to see who was holding it jesus christ a little black boy at the trigger he swore and his eyes burned with anger this startled the creole boy and he ran away as fast as his legs could carry him the spell was broken the hellish terrace disappeared like snow in the sun and a heavy load slid off michels shoulders then the bedroom was revealed where anne was still holding his hand what a vipers nest her husband groaned as he returned to consciousness then he resiliently got up out of bed and left his wife sitting there her jaw dropped sorry darling he apologized and he came back to give her a kiss just one question what were you telling diane last night just a fairytale with a happy ending she stammered why i think she fantasized about me would you mind singing her a lullaby next time but shes too old for that now anne said as she got up from the bed okay something else then as long as it doesnt remind her of me and he walked up to meet his clerk who was in the attic ill have to have a word with paul today he had to get off his chest when he got upstairs otherwise that boy will grow up to be behind bars are you feeling better master his helper asked with a quivering feather in his hand im a tough cookie christophe although my damn rheumatism is bothering me a bit and he wrote down some notes about the virtual world which had earlier had him in its grip artificial dark land with me playing the lead role he scribbled in his sketchbook would you find me all the fairytales that have magical weapons in them please he asked his secretary promised to do it as soon as possible some day children will be in charge of the world his master explained i sure hope not christophe said once he had his pen back under control so dont produce any offspring its already too late for me and the scholar got on with the order of the day tonight i will have to see if its written in the stars he thought he wrestled with a stack of horoscopes for the rest of that afternoon a heavy gong sounded throughout the entire house and everyone covered their ears the silver oil lamp a present from count ercole as compensation almost danced right off the table and the house maid was so startled she ran into the street youve got another new toy anne complained when her husband came down the stairs in ecstasy im testing my new gong he said a bit defensively i just got it delivered from marseille yesterday youre not going to use it to play music are you she asked in all seriousness because then everyone in the entire neighborhood would disappear including your own family no no of course not you dont have to worry about that he assured her then he sat down in his usual spot next to the hearth to enjoy the released energy anne was about to do madeleines hair their daughter was already waiting at the big table in front of the window which had a nice view of the garden while a meager sunray lit up the mother and daughter father watched the entertaining spectacle from his lazy chair he poured himself a glass of wine an hour later the last braid was being braided and mother gathered all the braids together and bound the whole into a crown just one more minute she said to her daughter who was getting tired of sitting still okay all done and she gave her the mirror happy with the hairdo which was done according to the latest venetian style madeleine thanked her mother my friends will be amazed she said and immediately went outside to show off the other kids came in and another day flew by by seven oclock that evening christophe had left the house and the master was taking a break enjoying the company of his wife on the porch youre going to have to do without me tonight the planets are favorably lined up right now and there is work to be done he informed her okay darling thats fine join me whenever you want to as long as you leave that gong alone she said and he stole up to his attic right away the driven seer lay down under a sheet and was surprised to notice that the gong beat was still reverberating in his body that thing sure is effective he mumbled and soon drifted off to other realms slowly a store window began to materialize in front of his third eye it had seethrough glass from floor to ceiling nostradamus gradually landed with his whole body in a shopping street and quickly looked around his presence had apparently not attracted any attention he was in a true buyers paradise people from all walks of life were walking around with fancy bags going in and out of the stores aside from many bargain hunters it was thick with recommended goods flashing advertisements and immeasurably tall buildings which touched the clouds the floor in front of which he had landed contained extremely advanced products he saw electric show boxes in all sizes and shapes that showed images of an announcer actors sporting events and especially many highly imaginative games the latter were socalled computer games and the screens showed a colorful collection of action figures which were constantly being shot at those games remind me of that country where i had the questionable privilege of playing a lead role he contemplated a river of jungle sounds flowed from the store which had its doors wide open and he swam towards the sound in the store with the deafening music rhythms and screaming animals customers were looking for strange products seemingly unbothered by the noise there was a long lineup of people waiting to pay for the inimitable goods the descriptions helped him a little bit he distinguished the audio television and computer departments and each had a wall full of equipment it made him feel dizzy then he discovered a huge offer of games on low racks all of them with warlike titles mostly kids who are enchanted with these dubious games he noticed looking around that murderous little african guy with his hellish weapon is unfortunately not the only one of his kind and he took a closer look at the display blockbuster space invaders battlefront he read oh dear if i see a title with my own name on it in a minute my future will not look good and he started to feel queasy thinking about the nasty creeps venting their frustrations on his image he noticed that there was information about the designer in small print on the back of the boxes that the games were in im going to have to remember this place he thought you never know fortunately he didnt see any game with his name on it suddenly an asian man from behind the counter which was shaped like the tree of life approached him can i help you he asked the cabbalist was about to answer him but the question was not addressed to him but to a small child in front of him unbelievable its that little black monster that nearly destroyed me im looking for the latest game of fool the magician the boy answered thats not out on the shelves yet the sales person said but no worries i will get you one from the back a few minutes later the boy was paying for the latest game at the cash register this means that my persona will be misused en masse michel shuddered as the young miscreant left the store hey you little fiend where are you going he called out grimly but the boy didnt hear him and crossed the street where there were only yellow cars driving around the scholar dashed after him but recoiled in the traffic and the boy disappeared in the crowd across the street how can a child be entertaining such ideas he wondered as he crossed the street with difficulty after a while he found the rascal again as he was walking to a bus stop on the sidewalk a bus stopped and the boy got in along with a few other people the roles have been reversed buddy the seer grumbled and he got into the bus in one second may i see you ticket please the driver asked michel grabbed his brown robe without pockets and apologized again it turned out the question was not addressed to him because an old lady obediently showed her ticket ghosts from other times were repeatedly overlooked everyone here was completely absorbed in the seduction of city life the passengers didnt look at anyone and everyone paid attention only to themselves the little black boy too he sat down in the back row next to a japanese person and started to play a pocket computer game his stalker sat down in an empty seat nearby if i could have a look at that game i should be able to find out who created it he thought and the bus left warehouses cafes museums and boutiques with the latest fashions whizzed past him all the streets in the city were numbered so it looked pretty easy to find your way around here the bus approached a gigantic city park with cultivated meadows woods and ponds this must be the new world the land of the northerners the dreamer supposed consciously making a mental note of each new insight he kept looking over at the boy who was still peacefully sitting in the back that little curlyhaired kid must not escape me he thought with the game in mind he actually doesnt look so bad either appearances are deceptive or i have judged him too hastily the boy suddenly jumped up and got off the bus which had stopped his pursuer hurried after him this time before the doors slammed shut he had some experience with these now the boy entered the central park and walked along a path between blooming shrubs towards a skateboard park where he was meeting some of his friends they came riding up to him on little boards with wheels hey joe one of them called out wheres your skateboard oh something came up i bought this really cool game and joe got the game out of his backpack the french ghost circled around it and tried to see the back of the box but joe was already putting it back the kids then climbed up into an old tree and soon jumped down again they started walking and crossed an iron footbridge the seer orientated himself and saw the impressive row of skyscrapers that bordered the park this is quite different from paris he thought at the zoo the boys decided to each go their own way and joe left the park through another exit he got on another bus and the ghost followed him again this bus drove along a boulevard with all kinds of theaters hotels and nightclubs the street was full of screaming billboards and the biggest one said coca cola enough to drive anyone insane michel thought its giving me a headache the boy meanwhile was playing with his pocket computer again with his backpack clasped between his legs after the exciting trip through the nightlife district with its neon lights the bus left the crowded island by driving onto an enormous bridge the seer turned around to catch a glimpse of the magnificent view the silhouette of the hollow mountains created a sharp contrast against the blue sky the city that overflows with abundance michel philosophized without losing track of joe but the boy was still playing with his computer after the bridge the bus turned right and drove along a walkway at the next stop the boy got off and trudged to a nearby residential area a few streets further on he rang the bell at a tidylooking row house and a woman opened the door you can play outside for a while if you want to joe his mother said dinner wont be ready for another half an hour her son sauntered back to the side of the river and sat down on a bench he took off his backpack and glanced at a stone guard in the distance holding up a torch then he opened his backpack took the game out and stared at the picture on the box with fascination turn that thing around nostradamus blurted out but his words had no effect whatsoever i have to do something to prevent this game from being distributed and he tried to pull the game out of joes hands but he couldnt get a grip on it he had no power in this realm and discouraged he sat down beside his former opponent i guess ill just have to accept the inevitable he was musing when suddenly joe began to talk to him wow its you and he held up the picture on the cover to show the sorcerer the latter recognized his own face it was a bit too angular and it made him look very grim but the resemblance was striking someone must have made this portrait of him without his knowledge probably during his visit to catherine de medici yes thats me but arent you scared of me no why joe asked never mind he answered grumpily being scared of ghosts was out of fashion apparently in the picture youre wearing a pirate hat joe continued an officers hat michel corrected him while touching his bald head but i lost it youre not from new york are you no im from another world but tell me are you looking forward to killing me soon joe was taken aback by this question and had to think about it for a few minutes its just a game he finally mumbled thats what you think but thoughts are powerful you know everybody plays games the boy replied doubtfully well hes really quite a sweet kid michel thought hes mostly just lacking in proper upbringing have you ever heard of karma no whos that its not a person but a cosmic law all your deeds and a thought is also a deed will have a reaction an intelligent being therefore will never perform any actions that go against the creation what does that have to do with this game joe asked not quite grasping it let me formulate it another way if thousands of kids start killing me my heart will become so heavy that i will have to burn in hell for eternity i dont want that to happen joe said me neither michel admitted i could still exchange this game a nice thought thanks but it wouldnt really make much of a difference because there are still many more copies oh no the boy suddenly shouted im going to be late for dinner and he ran off the sorcerer was left behind dumbfounded he quickly pulled himself together and caught up to joe hey is that how people say goodbye around here oh sorry but i have to be on time i can ask if you can stay for dinner and they reached the house where he rang the doorbell again his mother opened the door grumbling we just finished eating son youre late and you got such a nice watch for your birthday im sorry mom well okay ill heat up your dinner for you she sighed would it be okay if my friend stays for dinner he asked carefully because it wasnt really the best time to be asking for a favor what friend i dont see anyone oh he was just here joe said looking around in surprise and followed his mom around in confusion a few minutes later he climbed up the stairs to his room with his hot dinner and there he found the magician waiting for him out of nowhere oh there you are where were you the boy asked i was there but you couldnt see me anymore joe looked somewhat bewildered and offered him a piece of chicken no thank you i just ate but you could really do me a favor and show me your new game you want to play no not really im not exactly eager to shoot myself down but i would like to know who created that awful game about me oh you could easily find out about that on the internet joe suggested while he finished his dinner internet whats that its the world wide web you can look up anything on it oh do you mean the akashic records um i dont know anything about those but i will show you on the computer and he turned on the device i want to be an information scientist when i grow up joe declared while he was waiting thats excellent but i hope you wont be inventing any of those murderous games but the boy didnt hear him because he was now absorbed in the noisy computer i thought you were disturbed before but actually youre okay michel said when joe stopped working the keyboard for a minute thank you by the way you have a beautiful ship over there on the windowsill its a scale model of the providence the boy said proudly it was used to transport slaves in the seventeenth century yes humans are not always kind are they homo homini lupus see this is a search engine you just type in keywords to search for stuff joe showed him when the screen came up and he immediately started to type in some words cant find anything yet he said after a few tries why dont you try designer game magician and fool all together michel suggested but that also didnt produce any results search engines that cant find anything he said scornfully just get the box and let me see the back of it its got to have the information on it joe got up and got his backpack which was lying in a corner of the room crap the games not in here i must have left it by the river lets go right away the magician said and they ran out of the house towards the walkway were too late the game is gone joe saw as they approached the bench he began to search the area and suddenly noticed something that guy over there hes got the plastic bag with my game in it okay lets go get it michel said but his friends face had turned white whats the matter he belongs to the crips joe answered scared theyre super dangerous well crip or chip i dont care i dont have any choice and he pushed the kid out of his way and purposefully started to go after the other guy hey arent you even going to say goodbye joe called out but the strange man was already out of earshot and resolutely flying after the youth its not my day today michel complained to himself as he caught up to the gang member the latter disappeared into the underground and threw a coin into a steel gate he walked through as it unlocked while the magician simply sailed through the bars they came to a platform where the crip had to wait he had a bored expression on his face he briefly glanced at his loot malcontented put it back into the pocket of his jacket and carelessly dropped the plastic bag on the ground after a few minutes a train stopped and he got in along with the ghost the train began to move again after a onehour trip with many stops where passengers got in and out he still hadnt taken out the game at least i have time and time doesnt have me michel thought sitting behind him with incredible patience finally the little scoundrel got out and halfway up the filthy stairs he ran into his friends who all had a particularly nasty look in their eyes if looks could kill the seer thought hey mike its about time you got here weve been waiting for you for ages said enrique a guy who was covered with tattoos i was chasing some jerks in brooklyn and couldnt get here any sooner mike lied so what are we doin bob who was wearing his baseball cap backwards asked its getting boring around here no ones been lynched for like 9 days but no bloods in sight since then said mike coolly guys the piss smell around here is making me sick enrique complained lets get going and they all walked up the stairs long live the bronx bob cheered when they got outside and the hooligans strutted through the neighborhood which was full of dismal apartment blocks id better be careful in this underworld michel thought to himself some evil spirit could easily attack me from behind because like attracts like it was getting to be evening and the three shady characters went into a store to buy some drinks the cash register was set up at a height of two meters and was being guarded like a fortress suddenly a police car came screaming around the corner with its sirens on fullblast and came to a screeching halt officers got out grabbed a random passerby and violently threw him onto the hood of the car the three crips watched fascinated while they guzzled from their cans at ease looks like someones getting picked up again enrique laughed they walked closer to the incident where a local resident was getting frisked because of some offense or other okay guys get that game out now michel thought his patience now starting to wear thin mike who still had the game in his pocket had other ideas though after stopping at a pub where the ghost gloomily waited at the bar the pals finally decided to go home one street further on they entered a shabbylooking apartment complex where they went up in a rickety elevator upstairs the crips went into a messy apartment where they dropped down on a worn out couch mike took off his jacket and brought the game into view nostradamus hurried closer but all he could see was the boys long fingers whatcha got there bob asked drunkenly oh a computer game i found in the street fool the magician mike answered we only fool bloods enrique blustered taking the box from him and throwing it out the window hey you jerk ill decide about that mike swore walking to the window to see where the thing had fallen this is my chance michel thought he dove through the window and flew down to the game which had fallen next to a garbage can but once he got down there he realized it had gotten too dark and he couldnt read the text some dreams are just like that he lamented everything goes wrong and he sat down beside the garbage can dejectedly ill just have to wait until it gets light out the night passed and early in the morning a garbage truck drove into the street one of the workers picked up all the loose garbage from the street and threw the game box into the grinder before the dreamer had even noticed what he was doing suddenly wide awake he bravely dove in after the game and ended up with the crushed garbage it took hours before the stinking trash was dumped onto a big garbage heap then the box finally fell out virtually undamaged and with the right side up eureka nostradamus shouted happily and he found an address hmm somewhere in manhattan he understood the street numbering is easy anyway he flew up like a rocket and raced to the crowded island once he had crossed the river he sped over the city towards downtown where he landed near a coffee house i think this is it and he hoofed it through the entrance where a crowd of people was waiting for the elevators along with the others he got into the box which brought them to the 99th floor in less than one minute not as fast as i am but it will do and he got out and started to look for the darn office that the game had come from number 214 216 218 here it is michel murmured wandering through the door of the design office like a ghost the predator is pretty limited he heard someone named max say to his designer its better to change the characters with biomods but you will have to pick them very carefully will that enable him to see his enemies through the walls john asked if need be the two men were sitting at a computer and were studying a picture of a game they were developing so this is where evil is sown the seer contemplated taking in everything ive gathered some information about the upgrade of wealth leech john resumed ill get the file he walked to his own work space and returned with a folder oh great thanks said max taking the folder from him whats happening with the extra download of the magician by the way michel pricked up his ears i just finished tinkering with that one for a week at home his colleague answered i made nostradamus more ingenious now he can use organic materials from dead bodies to recover the first reactions have not been great max grumbled maybe it will be better with these new additions to tell you the truth i dont really find him exciting enough to shoot at cant you make him look more dangerous but in such a way that he still looks like a magician ill see what i can do yeah well you know kids want violence not subtlety of course i already took out the library and there are laser beams coming out of his eyes now but ill change his appearance too okay well ill get to work then said max and his colleague left him and walked to his workspace down the hall after getting himself a cup of coffee john sat down at one of the computers by the window an image of the famous seer immediately appeared and he began to deform him experimentally hey thats my head and my body michel squeaked looking over his shoulder undisturbed john removed the pirate hat and pasted a wild hairdo in its place then he cut off the beard but after some dawdling put it back on again and made it longer so it reached down to the ground he briefly reflected on his new approach while the lead player was looking at drawings of himself lying around beside the computer this game must absolutely not become a success he thought determinedly and began to devise a plan of attack john meanwhile had taken off the limbs in order to rebuild the torso he stretched the cropped body in all directions and let it suffer all kinds of horrible diseases finally he ended up with a blownup combatant who only vaguely resembled a magician in the meantime the desperate ghost was directing all of his powers at the computer which promptly froze oh no not that again john complained a second later his coffee spilled all over the challenged drawings on the desk this is getting creepy he stuttered he called his boss and told him what was happening i dont believe in ghosts max replied caustically im sure you spilled your coffee yourself and computers just freeze sometimes i never even touched my coffee john protested maybe this game is sacrilege it was your idea youre the one who wanted nostradamus as an action figure yes because when we did our market research he was very popular john defended himself while dabbing the spilled coffee with a cleaning cloth oh well at least i made some copies and backups while the two men were squabbling over the existence of god michels conscience began to gnaw at him he realized that he was messing with fate and began to doubt the rightness of his meddling i really should know better he realized i let myself be influenced by fear i am lacking in faith of the almighty his intuition also told him that there could be some consequences if the roof collapses too max suddenly said loudly i will believe you it seemed like the devil was playing along because right at that moment a big airplane flew straight towards them michel saw the monster coming and was totally perplexed my god did i cause that he wondered feeling very guilty but no it had to be a coincidence the airplane drilled into the tower right underneath them and the whole building began to sway dangerously with the intense shock immediately all the lights and the computers went out john and max their jaws dropped stared at what could not be happening and then held on tightly to each other in fear the seer rushed to the window where gigantic smoke clouds were rising below him debris was flying in all directions with bodies mixed in the two designers were now walking around in a daze and suddenly began to cry when office staff from the floors above them began to stream in from the stairs they snapped out of it and sprang into action they ran to the elevators like they were possessed but they were out of order hysterically they scratched at the elevator doors a series of explosions followed and then a bunch of suffocating smoke mixed with the smell of blood and burned clothing filled the room people were screaming and in desperation started jumping out the windows a minute later a second airplane flew into a nearby skyscraper and the enormous explosion caused the building to sway again it was complete pandemonium a huge sea of fire cut off the way downstairs and soon both buildings collapsed nostradamus was pulled back by the automatic protection of his earthly body and opened his eyes in a state of shock in his own work room the unprecedented attack was etched into his memory for ever de chavigny was ready with his pen his master was about to dictate something to him he was suffering from gout okay christophe write down from the sky will come a king of terror and he diligently dipped his pen into the ink and wrote down the words given to him oh wait a minute change that last part to king of horror the clerk crossed out the passage while his boss was looking out the attic window at the autumn sky christophe waited at his desk for a new line of the verse the great mongolian leader will arise from the dead the scholar continued and the tapping against the ink pot could be heard again no thats too clear change it to the king of angolmois will arise from the dead and again he corrected the text in closing 1999 the seventh month after and before mars will rule with happiness that will be in over 436 years master if my calculations are correct no im not making it that simple the date of execution of this quatrain will be 2012 nostradamus invented oh not till then the clerk mumbled feeling lost lets go and sit on the porch christophe its one of the most beautiful autumn days of the year and both men went downstairs all finished with your work anne asked she was sorting out old stuff with the maid no were going to work outside her husband answered while he took some letters out of his private desk before leaving the living room hey a new rocking chair the clerk noticed when they got to the porch yes its for stopping my thoughts his boss explained sitting down in a wicker chair christophe i would like you to reply to this letter from bishop méandre today that man is demanding that i need his authorization before the publication of my next almanac méandre is a narrowminded man yes i agree and apparently i am encroaching on his territory but write him a polite letter and explain that unfortunately i cannot meet his demand for the following reasons the content of my almanac is not blasphemous and does not harm the church in any way furthermore i cannot carry out my work with imposed restrictions christophe promised to take care of it just then anne came in and interrupted the business talks pauline is sick would you mind having a look at her she asked worried her husband got up to examine his daughter pauline was curled up into a little ball in the corner of the living room let daddy take a look sweetheart he crooned and she came out of her cocoon she was looking pale it looks to me like youve just caught a cold summer is over you know better start wearing a coat and he picked her up and put her down at the table ill make you a hot drink and after youve drunk it youre going to bed until you feel better agreed the girl nodded timidly he went to the kitchen and a few minutes later returned with an herbal mixture to the last drop yuck pauline complained after the first sip and she pushed the drink away come on if you want to get better you have to make a small sacrifice and when she had finished the medicine he brought the patient to her bed back with his secretary he resumed his work they spoke extensively about the new almanac which had to be finished this week piggy nose piggy nose one of the kids was suddenly teasing andré youd better leave mr de chavigny alone he can write english better than you and me together the boy came out from behind the shrub and tried to figure out what to do next i wonder if maybe i dont pay enough attention to my kids father pondered and had an idea andré would you come here please his son came out of the garden go and ask your brothers and sisters if they feel like having a fire by the river the boy ran off happily after lunch christophe disappeared upstairs and the scholar got ready to go out with his kids in the living room whos coming to the touloubre he wanted to know andré césar and me paul answered daringly slouching in his dads chair no one else but there didnt seem to be any other candidates okay it will be just us men then father determined and picked up the tinderbox from the mantle why dont you take some fishing rods said anne then we can have fish tomorrow her husband picked up the fishing gear from the shed and the men left you forgot to take a bucket anne called after them but they didnt hear her and left town by a secret path to avoid fathers admirers oh my goodness we forgot to bring a bucket he discovered halfway down sycamore lane ill go back and get one césar offered and a bit later he rejoined them with the bucket they arrived at the river which flowed south of salon and squabbled about where the best cast would be the best place is definitely on the other side by the cypresses paul was sure they decided to take his advice and crossed the roman footbridge im turning eight next week andré announced when they got to the other shore dont worry we wont forget son but what are we going to do first fish or light a fire paul had already cast his rod and they again took his lead would you put some bait on my hook please césar father whose fingers were hurting him a bit asked and the boy stuck a piece of dough on it for him the four of them sat amiably at the waterside this way and paul was the first one to get a bite how come youre always the first one andré called out jealously i do this quite often his brother informed him practice makes perfect father agreed and they all stared at their floats some more the guilds are setting up a school césar commented id like to go to it excellent i like to see my offspring use their brains and what do you think of school paul father asked well its okay but i really like music much better got one and he pulled out a bass by the way im going to play music with lisette on saturday in the tambourine he said while putting his fish in the bucket isnt that de craponnes daughter father asked thats right lisette plays the viol she is learning a piece for the opening of the canal which is being extended to salon next year césar and andré had also caught a fish by now im not getting a bite it takes a certain knack dad paul opined youve either got it or you dont suddenly michels float disappeared far below the surface and he had to pull on his fishing rod with all his might a giant squid flew into the air and angrily stretched out its tentacles to him confounded the seer was taken into a stranglehold and fought back in mortal fear just when he was starting to suffocate the monster suddenly vanished tsk what kind of omen could that be he thought while catching his breath and recovering from the mirage thats enough fish for us just throw the next one back into the water he said under control to his sons who hadnt noticed anything lets build a fire then andré suggested and they all put down their fishing rods a few minutes after they collected some wood and dead branches they had a roaring fire can we put a fish on it right away im hungry paul suggested we just ate said césar were going to take all the fish to mother father decided shell fry them tomorrow when the fire had burned out and it started to get a bit chilly they decided to start heading back home what are you doing carrying around that heavy boulder andré paul asked when they crossing the bridge his brother then dropped the rock into the river while he was getting splashed father was anxiously looking to make sure no angry tentacles were rising up out of the water king winter was keeping the country in its grip the temperature had plummeted downward drastically in just a few days and it was colder than it had ever been a paddy wagon accompanied by gendarmes arrived at the narrow square in the heart of salon and stopped at number two while some of the neighbors were hanging out of their windows with curiosity the officers got off their horses and the commander knocked on the door with a stern look on his face nostradamus shunning the light appeared at the window and finally understood the portent of a month earlier michel de nostredame in the name of the law you are under arrest the head officer proclaimed when the scholar opened the door he was given one minute to collect some clothes and say goodbye to this family anne arrived too late and watched with sorrowful eyes as her husband disappeared into the wagon with a duffle bag michel she screamed through the streets the whole town was up in arms the muchpraised scientist was moved past the townspeople in chains and the strangest rumors immediately began to circulate the old detainee was taken to the castle of marignane outside of marseille and there he was locked up like a common criminal later that day he got a visit from claude de tende the governor of provence im terribly sorry michel his friend began looking as white as a ghost bishop méandre forced me to have you arrested because of your deviant publications he threatened to take me to court too if i didnt cooperate there are a few sensitive issues from my past which he could use against me oh it was my own fault im the one whos been so eager to get published i just hope i get to see my family again theres more bad news claude said gloomily theres been an attack on the pope he survived but your friend rabelais didnt hes been murdered that was another big hit for nostradamus to sustain i used to be able to foresee these kinds of things he thought i was still pure then but my success has been going to my head lately i thought i was invulnerable i am a useless seer claude he said not thats not true its just that the bishop has more power than any of us could have imagined yes and now i will have to defend myself against the highest boss of the church and the outcome is predetermined the bestcase scenario will be a dragged out conflict for years which will do me in well lets still hope for a positive outcome and i assure you again my hands are tied the governor said goodbye to his friend while in prison the scholar did some exercises every day in order to stay healthy but after a week in the cold he began to weaken dangerously his old age and the rheumatism took over and he finally had to succumb and just lie on the bench he just stared outside through the bars of the window it was snowing a rare event in the south of france a few snowflakes fluttered in through the window and fell onto his frozen hands it looks like i might perish before i ever even set foot in a courtroom he moaned well id better not waste my time fretting over it and he gathered his blanket around himself faith thats all i can do just keep up the faith and due to exhaustion his spirit absconded a caravan was traveling through the desert towards the snowcovered mountain tops the dusty wind blowing from the southwest made the journey more difficult for the group women and children bringing up the rear getty up the donkey drivers repeatedly shouted finally the fugitives left the barren plain with their loadeddown pack animals to find shelter in the foothills well set up camp here the leader with the blue turban commanded when they entered a rocky valley the caravan came to a halt and the badgered tribe got a chance to rest a few carriers got bottles of water from the packs on the donkeys and passed them out be frugal with it the leader warned this has to last us for a few more days from high on a red cliff a mountain dweller was observing the group beshir go to that man and ask who he is his boss commanded it looks like he is a pashtun beshir climbed up the rock mass and after a while he reached the man who was calmly standing there wearing a long brown robe may i ask who you are the scout asked catching his breath from climbing the last of the rocks you may call me discute the stranger answered his thick beard was flapping in the wind while he himself stood motionless in the sun my name is beshir and we are pathanes from the north we are looking for a save haven in the mountains then i advise you to leave this valley immediately because a hellish rain will destroy this valley within twenty minutes the scout looked at him in astonishment i would appreciate it if you could tell my leader about this he finally said together they climbed down the rocks and they soon reached the camp where beshir introduced the strange character to his boss have we met before the latter asked not that i recall the mountain dweller answered so this valley is on the verge of being destroyed where do you get this information i am in touch with the all the mountain dweller claimed over there on the right beneath that crevice you will find a cave where all of you can hide is it true about that cave the leader asked beshir nodded his boss thought for a moment and then motioned to one of his men alalaam immediately take all the women and children and half of our men to the cave that beshir will show you the others will continue to set up camp alalaam hurriedly split up the pathanes and with beshir in the lead hundreds of tribesmen went down into the crevice i cannot let you go free the leader told discute you will have to enter the cave with us because we must always be prepared for traitors and his men kept him within shooting range but if you are right we will be very grateful and we will richly reward you and the socalled prophet was forced to go along there is not much time left the stranger said gravely while they descended well see the leader responded and a few moments later they entered the cave where the group that had left earlier had already taken cover its a tunnel going all the way through boss beshir who was just coming back called out it runs through to the next valley and suddenly a gigantic explosion made the mountain shake on its foundations and the guards at the entrance were thrown into the cave large chunks of rock were falling down from the ceiling hazardously and most people fell down it got quiet again and the pathanes got up feeling shaky that was a major blast the leader mumbled shaking the dust off his clothes the damage turned out to be minimal there were just a few slightly wounded the leader hurried outside with his confidants to see how his other men were an unprecedented large bomb had completely destroyed the valley and left it in ruins there was nothing left of the camp or any of their fellow fighters the little group went back into the cave and the boss went to look for his guest i havent introduced myself yet i am osama bin laden you are free to go now however i hope that you will stay with us and help us with your special gifts i help all of mankind and i will stay with you until the danger has abated the prophet said that will be entirely satisfactory to me is mohammad still all right bin laden asked alalaam yes boss he is repacking his mule tell him that we will rest here and from now on we will travel at night and his helper disappeared down the narrow corridor which was full of exhausted escapees the enemy will not catch us bin laden encouraged everyone allah has just sent us his son and all his people cheered now rest because tonight we will travel on yasser give our brave rescuer blankets and food the assistant took discute into the tunnel and they passed some soldiers who were getting their weapons ready the newcomer received the necessary articles from a veiled woman relatively few woman and children he commented wondering why all the women and children are osamas yasser clarified after they had eaten and drunk the pathanes rested except for a few guards at the entrance once the sun had gone down bin laden invited his mysterious guest to attend the jirga he accepted they were walking to the board together when osama was struck by an inspiration now i remember where i know you from he said years ago i had an inspiring dream in which an old wise man beckoned to me from a skyscraper that was you instantly nostradamus regained his presence of mind and he got a view of the whole peculiar situation well ill be i personally served that chief myself just like the genie summoned from aladdins lamp that muslim must have some special powers he thought and still feeling a bit foggy he tried to put the pieces together a number of wise men were already sitting in the conclave and osama and his guest joined them our fighters will continue to engage in holy warfare someone named mullah whose face was hidden behind a cloth spoke but how we are barely surviving and prevalence of the unbelievers is great another board member said the militant ahmed now moved first we have to get ourselves properly situated in the mountains and then we will strike with the force of destruction he proposed yes this is good we all want to continue the fight against the christian dogs mullah summarized therefore i argue for a decisive last battle and allah will lead us to victory no if we want to win the battle against the americans we must escape osama commented critically besides in military terms we do not even exist what did you have in mind go into hiding in jalalabad or cross the border mullah asked yes i was thinking of pakistan where we will be able to plan new attacks against the west on all fronts a number of wise men agreed with him what does discute think about all this osama asked well im no strategist he said by now realizing that he was not in the company of a bunch of peace lovers dont you foresee certain dangers no im not getting anything at the moment he answered cautiously the board finally decided to cross the border to pakistan by way of the khyber pass the trek through the capricious mountains was very risky but once they had arrived in the neighboring country they would be safe among friendly tribes beshir in the meantime was waking everybody up because it was time to be on their way while the caravan slowly began to move the clairvoyant went to join bin laden are you a sunnite the latter asked casually no im not shiite but discute indicated he didnt belong to them either but you are a muslim brother arent you i behave according to the rules of the supreme being he is called god or allah well dont let any of the others hear you say that in any case you are against the americans the convoy came to a brief standstill because the tunnel was too narrow to easily pass through why are you engaging in warfare discute asked the americans are permanently in saudiarabia and are defiling the holy land with their presence americans those are the inhabitants of the new world arent they are you stuck in time or something the crusaders are from far away yes but from the new world the ruined world you mean and the corner of osamas mouth curled in a cruel sneer why are the americans bombing you we attacked them in order to destroy their power you mean like that attack on that skyscraper yes and you gave me the idea but youre sure asking a lot of questions osama said irritated and ended the conversation holy mackerel its the antichrist thats mentioned in the bible nostradamus suddenly understood ive been allowing myself to be misled by the future son of destruction its truly bizarre the way im getting tested eventually the fighters reached the outside world and the coast appeared to be clear the convoy then continued its journey under the open sky across a rocky plane that was bordered by mountain ranges on both sides the procession did not travel very fast and bin laden was getting worried a helicopter everyone hide he suddenly shouted in the distance there was a hideous noise that quickly came closer and the fugitives hurriedly hid in holes and crevices and kept completely quiet a searchlight shone onto the inhospitable landscape and soon disappeared again after which the leader commanded everyone to resume marching the weather conditions changed to their favor the ascending clouds kept the caravan out of sight after a long trip beshir pointed to a cave where his people would hide during the day then it began to rain and the last of the donkeys were pulled into the hiding place the overstrained arabs got a chance to catch their breath ive got some bad new bin laden said to his accomplices the crusaders are doing a pincer movement and combing through all the caves then we are lost alalaam wailed no these mountains can obviously not be sealed off his boss replied im sure the americans will bribe some local tribes and they will give us away ahmed suggested the mountain dwellers are all loyal to me the usually silent mullah reassured them maybe our friend discute will receive more signs from above osama said but discute remained aloof and was not planning the play along anymore a few hours later the guards at the entrance were unexpectedly shot at some american group had found them get up and keep walking the leader immediately commanded the militant disciples quickly picked themselves up and went deeper into the mountain then some faithful followers blew up the entrance to the cave the way in was permanently blocked for the enemy and for the moment they were safe beshir led the group through various corridors at great speed and a little later they were back outside this time they found themselves on a rough mountain ridge where a violent snow storm was raging they were virtually completely blinded on the slippery slopes but that did not deter the tough pathanes slowly but surely they traveled over the rugged ridges they walked past the ruins of an airplane that had crashed some time in the past a fellow pashtun suddenly came out of the snow and after a short discussion with the mountain dweller it was decided to take a different path whats going on discute who was starting to turn blue from the cold asked the usual entrance is being patrolled by enemy afghans and the pakistani army is at the border yasser answered with great determination the rank slogged on past ravines and granite peaks ever eastward despite the severe weather they managed to reach the other pass to pakistan and shortly after crossing the border they took a brief rest after this the leader put a select group together which included his family members and ordered some hundred remaining warriors to march to the village of peshawar their boss was planning to go into hiding elsewhere but wisely kept the location a secret men our ways must now part for a while bin laden announced if i dont survive we will see each other in paradise long live osama they chanted they are brave fellows but they will be eliminated in a flash nostradamus thought their role is finished discute i would like you to come with us osama requested because you may be able to serve us with your divine gifts i will accompany you as long as i am meant to he replied the selected group began to walk to the north with two mules while the majority of the men kept moving south would it not have been wiser for us to also keep going to the south where our sympathizers live alalaam asked on the way no thats where the americans will be looking for us his boss answered after some time they came out of the mountains and arrived at a steppe where two cars were waiting at the side of a creek to be on the safe side the group hid behind some rocks after which beshir whistled a signal zindibad osama was the answer at the pond its okay beshir assured everyone and they went on at the creek they jumped into the terrain vehicles and they sped off after riding for hours on bumpy dirt roads they arrived at a dilapidated building it was situated on a bare deserted plane surrounded by white mountains welcome to bar chamarkand osama jested exhausted they all got out and entered the house which had about a dozen eroded rooms the wind had free reign in it because none of the windows had any shutters brr a dreary cottage michel thought the women were assigned their own room and the men took possession of the main space where they laid down their weapons they let the children play outside for a bit they would only mislead the enemy rather than attract them heres a drink for you discute mullah called out the clairvoyant surprisingly caught the can of mecca cola thrown to him looks like my spirit power has grown he observed happily the exhausted warriors lay down on some mattresses and discute leaned against the window post outside one of the daughters of osama was amusing herself with a butterfly made of colored glass nostradamus wanted to give some attention to the girl when suddenly she was gone a few seconds later she unexpectedly poked her head up through the window peekaboo she called out her eyes shining with joy hello little girl he said moved the cheerful meeting was cut short though discute come over here and take a look at this her father called he had changed into some clean clothes and was now walking around in army gear a portable television showed the airplane that had purposely crashed into the skyscraper that nostradamus had been in at that moment the men were all watching the images excitedly osama bin laden the brains behind the attacks on the twin towers has managed to escape from the tora bora mountains along with other ringleaders newscaster was saying the saudi muslim fundamentalist who made his fortune in drugs has almost mythical proportions thats a lie someone shouted in the room the most soughtafter terrorist in the world is very popular among the afghan and pakistani population because he supplies weapons training food and medicine the golden tip that leads to the arrest of bin laden is worth about twentyfive million dollars ive seen enough osama said and while he walked away his men saw pictures of him on the screen beshir meanwhile was hauling some boxes while discute was watching him and sipping his coke these people are not particularly constructive he thought when he heard a bang in one of the rooms curious he left the warriors behind glued to the tube and went to check out the rooms what happened to all the women he wondered he saw that some boxes had fallen down in an improvised office a box that was decorated with palm trees had broken and some documents lay spread out on the floor he bent over the papers and focused his eyes oh dear einstein will not be happy about this the information was about how to build a nuclear bomb so you are an american spy after all bin laden said suddenly from behind him i should have known and he called his accomplices alalaam lock this traitor up but he saved our lives he is trying to infiltrate the leader said unrelentingly and the false prophet was locked into a storage room where he could once again think clearly now i should be able to automatically get back to my cell in marignane michel thought but nothing happened my god my next thought pattern has to be broken then heard the keys jingling and the door opened in the door opening stood osamas daughter wearing a little paper crown on her head she smiled michel you are a free man once again the governor of provence said and his voice brought him back to the present thank you very much young lady the scholar answered and got up from his bench with some difficulty youre raving my friend i hope youre not losing your sanity its all right the tide has turned thank god and he hobbled towards him the charge against you has been dropped claude explained while nostradamus stuck his nose out of the bars long live the queen he called out hoarsely claude didnt say anything but his face spoke volumes in salon songs were sung for the returned hero who weakly waved at his admirers from the balcony the entire city council was among the crowd flocking towards him dont stay out there too long michel youre ready to fall over anne said worriedly he promised to keep it short dear family friends and fellow townspeople i am a free man once again he began and the crowd cheered then they quieted down so they could hear him speak thoughts however can never be imprisoned and in my cell i had many visions which i will write down and i will publish them as before after all out of the darkness the light will always shine again alas thats all i can say right now because my body needs to rest the weakened scholar then closed the balcony doors and went straight to bed tonight would be a good opportunity to give césar a tour of the constellations and nostradamus went to look for his son have you seen césar anywhere he asked anne downstairs she was soaking her feet in a tub of warm water well late this afternoon he was doing some chores in the municipal archives but i dont know where he is now why the stars will be shining tonight and i want to initiate him he explained the boy was nowhere to be found however and his father decided to get some work done in the attic he hadnt been using this room for his meditation for some time christophe spent most of his time there he didnt really need isolation anymore his preternatural gifts had been merging into the busy household over the years and the quietude he needed was anchored in his heart just as he was putting the finishing touches on a horoscope for a client his son came in well if it isnt my césar he said lightheartedly are we going to look at celestial bodies dad the teenager asked while eyeing the embryos in the display case your timing couldnt be better my boy and father closed his book he stood up opened the skylight and took the cover off the manhigh spyglass which was set up underneath it youre already almost as tall as this instrument he mumbled looking at his son okay well lets see there it is look césar just above the last rays of the sun mercury the planet of intelligence and mental capacity over twentyeight zodiac degrees from the sun all i see is a small pink dot césar remarked gazing through the device small but significant but i admit its an acquired taste boys prefer something more spectacular and father aimed the apparatus at the moon now look wow thats beautiful césar said amazement is the beginning of wisdom father quoted and a little while later when it was dark he showed his son all the remote corners of the sky just like his grandfather had shown him a long time ago in june there was a festival in the town bertrand and his buddies had finally finished digging the canal de craponne all the way to salon and the irrigation canal was opened with much fanfare once the engineer of the project had personally opened the lock and the water was flowing freely after a loud applause a band played a piece of music they had rehearsed for the occasion anne wanted to extend the festivities to her home because her husband had been unable to attend due to his rheumatism his brothers antoine and julien and their families were invited and of course bertrand was part of the party too in the backyard long dining tables had set up because the family had expanded quite a bit during the course of the last few years the number of children was overwhelming the resident offspring were running zigzag through the crowd of adults it was a busy scene michel had ordered a barrel of champagne from reims for the occasion and the four brothers had a toast in honor of the completed project in the back of the garden the women were frying chicken hey leave some for us honorable sirs anne called out while she turned the spit without us they are totally lost she whispered to the ladies who by now had gotten used to her liberal attitude bertrand was telling tall tales with a flourish and the kids could not be pried away from him but once the chicken was ready he had to admit defeat the women brought the poultry to the table and served it to the hungry guests no thank you michel was the only one to decline what youre passing up that delicious meat julien asked that used to be your favorite yes it used to be but now i prefer the scents of nature come on skip a day michel today is a special day bertrand requested no i have to consider my health just a little piece to be social antoine implored but their learned brother persevered then ill pour you some more champagne or is that bad for your health too bertrand asked all right just half a glass then michel said stiffly and then everyone set about devouring the chickens its absolutely delicious ladies certainly nothing to be spurned the men praised them a little later finances became the topic of discussion that was a good tip you gave us bertrand to invest in the canal anne said good interest and the value of the shares has risen we would like to invest another hundred crowns thats great to hear well arrange it the contractor answered between bites it did take nine years before the canal was here michel said critically thats about two kilometers a year a snail would do it faster go ahead and make fun of me brother the profits are crystalclear in the book for all to see bertrand responded while helping himself to some beans if you guys ever get into a dispute i can give you legal advice well keep everything in the family of course julien joked playing the lawyer and lavishing himself with champagne doesnt it drive you starkraving mad all those people always standing in front of your house juliens wife sabine asked yes thats the disadvantage of being famous michel answered as one of the little ones walked into the garden fence anybody can just climb right over that fence bertrand commented im surprised you dont have any intruders youre right we do have to protect the house better and its time we had the placed fixed up and redecorated as well his brother admitted then i have a brilliant idea bertrand said theres a house in avignon thats standing empty which you could rent for a few months in the meantime i will renovate your house for a fair price and you will be freed of those pilgrims for a while two birds with one stone what do you think arent you too busy michel asked oh well there are always projects on the go but the biggest one the canal is done and for my brother the whiz kid i can make the time i know where to get the best and most beautiful materials just one tip keep the front simple so the taxes wont rise skyhigh im sick and tired of those jokes about my work antoine replied to that unexpectedly fierce sorry brother im exaggerating the taxes are not that bad bertrand placated in the big cities theyre even competing about who has the most beautiful building i think its a plausible proposal michel said finally what do you think anne shall we go and live in avignon for a while its already written in the stars she answered a little tipsy ill come up with a good plan bertrand resumed you dont have to make any decisions until youve seen it michel tell us about the future of mankind elise who was sitting there feeling a little lost asked but he didnt get a chance because andré knocked over a glass of wine in front of him its all part of a good party bertrand laughed speaking of parties julien picked up the thread next month is shavuoth do any of you celebrate it not me michel replied while mopping up the spilled wine any of you guys but it seemed that only the lawyer in the family was still keeping the jewish traditions secretly of course before i go bertrand said towards the end i would like to propose a toast to our father and mother they gave us a lot to be thankful for and the brothers unanimously raised their glasses once the building plans had been approved bertrand immediately began to renovate the house with his workmen in the meantime the de nostredames traveled to avignon by coach and before noon they were crossing the bridge of avignon they rode into the uninviting town where father had studied astrology in his younger days all the streets were still very familiar to him and as though fate was playing with him the house they were to move into was situated on the parc des papes near his old university which was now being used for a different purpose they got out of the coach and carried their belongings into the house the fancy home was completely furnished and it didnt take for them to feel completely comfortable michel had brought only a bit of work and had plenty of time to spend with anne and the children the next day he showed his family the town from the rocher des doms the cliff that rose high above everything after that all eight of them walked through avignon and visited several places such as the rue st agricol where father had once lived in an impoverished little room now there was a store selling trinkets and toys in that location the family enjoyed their time in the worldly city but father soon developed pain in his joints which forced him to stay close to home my body seems to be decreasing in resilience every year he grumbled while he sat down on a bench in the park which had survived the passage of time he looked at the old oaks he had known they didnt seem diminished in their strength either michel were going to the toy store well be back shortly anne reported okay ill be fine toy store while his family was gone the wind was caressing his aching knuckles and memories of his youth began to float to the surface time has really slipped through my fingers like sand he reflected a little while later anne and the kids returned with their bags full my goodness they look just like bargain hunters from the new world he thought feeling cheerful once more and they began to unwrap the toys right in the middle of the field he was curious and stood up but had to sit down again to button up his shoe that damned gout i cant even hold a shoelace anymore michel come and see what we bought his wife called im coming im coming he driveled while he got up in the meantime andré was jumping through a rolling hula hoop and césar was trying to imitate the fancy trick youre too big for that hula hoop madeleine screamed looking up for a minute before continuing to rummage through the bags again the scholar had reached his family members and joined them in going through the newly acquired treasures there were skipping ropes a ball dolls marbles a kite glue felt too much to take in all at once diane was walking around with a chubby chinese doll i wonder how long this will keep them occupied michel thought sitting down in the grass with his wife will you play with us dad paul asked were going to play tag you kids go ahead your mother and i will watch hey im not an old fart anne protested and she jumped up and playfully chased paul as he flew off so the days passed and everyone enjoyed their freedom after some time the sons started to get rowdy and the neighbors peevish father just let them be but when one day they were playing butcher and paul wanted to cut dianes belly open with a pen knife he intervened okay thats enough now give me that knife and go to your room he said angrily and his offspring quickly returned to moderately good behavior one day the seer was recognized by some folks in the street and shamelessly harassed soon they were waiting in front of their house and he decided to spend the rest of his time there indoors the family played the board game carcasonne over and over until they were sick of it the kids had never had so much fun however one evening michel had some visions of the superrich west which would slowly but surely deteriorate just then pauline padded into his room wearing a pointed hat she had glued together and a black ribbon on her back cant we go on vacation more often dad she asked when youre all grown up you can travel as much as you like he replied the future europeans do nothing but it took two months before anne finally grew tired of the unlimited freedom im worn out she said one day im yearning to be back in our own house i even miss christophe im expecting a message from bertand any day her husband informed her when the children were playing ball in the attic the next day the liberating message arrived for their parents the house was ready back in salon nostradamus worshippers had grown tired of waiting to catch a glimpse of him and had disappeared there was no one spying on the house which now had a new face only one person was there bertrand who was waiting for them and pointed at the new façade its a master piece he said full of pride when they got out of the coach but our house isnt as cozy the children complained immediately the whole balcony had been removed to prevent easy breakin and the bottom windows now all had bars in front of them the new sturdy front door had large hinges and a peephole the house looked a bit like a prison the windows however were quite striking having been fashioned of genuine glass they were a delight for the eye and they were the first ones in town in order to protect the expensive stained glass the shutters had been left intact let me give you a tour bertrand suggested and they all went inside the living room had been redone with darkred wooden paneling and the walls had been painted a nice beige the floor now had seamless blackgray tiles and there was an impressive chandelier hanging from the ceiling most of the old furniture had been replaced with new pieces there was a red sofa for example and andré immediately climbed up on it youd better get down from there this minute his father warned thats not for children most of the work was done in the guest house bertrand said while they went through the garden to get to it the veranda was now completely covered because of the new premises which could be reached by an outside staircase well i think youve done an excellent job anne said after shed seen it all her husband was also completely positive hidden beauty he summed it up nostradamus threw himself into his masterpiece again which had reached an advanced stage and he would from now on receive his visitors on the sofa it had become quiet in the house now that the three oldest children were being educated in arles michel shuffled to the veranda with a cup of hot milk and sat down in a dark corner a nice little drink and then see what happens he mumbled when hed finished the milk he closed his eyes and concentrated the information from above immediately suffused his body my body might be deteriorating but at the spiritual level im still going forward he observed happily and he gradually became one with the future ghosts who were making the most heinous plans were flitting past his head he noticed that one of the ideas had the potential to fructify and decided to follow the process the catastrophe would take place near erasmus town late one night a van occupied by two malevolent individuals stopped in a village near rotterdam just north of the rhine they searched the area until they were sure that they were not being observed then they drove off the road between some glass greenhouses at the end of the ride they parked the vehicle in a hidden spot and again checked the area for spectators it was totally quiet and the villagers all appeared to be sound asleep they carefully opened the backdoor of the vehicle and took out a covered object jan be careful mohammed whispered the men carried the long object across a railroad track and dragged it to the river when they arrived at the dike they nervously looked to the other side where some gigantic oil tanks were set up and perpetual fires were burning theres no better place than this mohammed said from here you can see almost all of the depots youre right but lets keep going it just after five and were behind schedule jan replied while hiding the object in the bushes they quickly walked back to the locked van and took out a heavy trunk which they also dragged to the edge of the river the moment of truth has arrived jan said loftily and he pulled the cover off he long object a gift from the saudi prince and they admired the missile launcher manufactured in america hey jan we are doing the right thing arent we were doing this for the true religion to make it flourish on top of the ruins of the decadent west this river will flow with the blood of the unbelievers he recited convinced mohammed placed the missile launcher on his friends shoulder and took the first grenade out of the box at the same time a large tanker was traveling from the sea onto the river and the oil supplies quickly disappeared from sight duck down we dont want the crew to see us jan commanded and they nervously hid behind the bushes the ship was moving towards an inner harbor further on and a moment later the storage tanks came into view again i hope youve practiced enough mohammed mumbled have some faith im going to shoot those things to smithereens this is going to be world news and jan checked the settings of the heavy weapon while his buddy was on guard finally the dutch muslim gave his arabic fellow believer the sign to get the first grenade okay brother its time jan said while he was down on one knee he pointed the weapon at the biggest fuel supply in europe i almost forgot to indicate the temperature of the tanks weve got ten grenades and ten percent can fail mohammed reacted and with a bit of luck the fire will spread his buddy then focused the view finder and saw a few rusty pipes on a forecourt he aimed a little above them the right target came into view michel where are you anne called but there was no answer oh there you are ive been looking everywhere for you the abrupt interruption didnt upset the seer those days were long gone what is it dear he asked with his eyes still closed andré had a little job in gougnauds apple orchard his helper broke a finger and it seems our son is responsible for this now he cant pick his apples anymore what should we do ill give it some thought he replied dreamily and another thing ill be going past the papermill do you want me to buy some paper for you yes go ahead pick up a package of sketch paper for me anne disappeared again and her husband again absorbed himself in the attack allah is great jan shouted and pulled the trigger the missile fired from his shoulder mesmerized the fighters followed the course of the projectile and watched how the first tank was hit fullon they cheered with glee and the gigantic explosion that followed broke the silence of the night the towering storage place burst open and the oil burst into flames now we must stay calm jan said seriously and his friend loaded a new missile the dutchman focused and again fired again he hit the bulls eye the second tank also burst into flames and again they were delighted meantime an alarm was sounding and guards were running for their lives next one jan dictated and his buddy placed the third grenade again a tank was hit we are being assisted from above mohammed said undoubtedly his buddy replied the two believers carried out their mission flawlessly and the next storage tank was exploding the sea of fire was lighting up the whole area where sparse trees were being scorched like match sticks panic had taken over the industrial property and anything that had wheels took off at top speed the heat was unbearable yes the fire is leaping to the other depots jan laughed suddenly a train was coming from their side threatening to disturb their activities whats going on why is there a train at this hour mohammed stammered were just going to finish the job there are only four grenades left i dont care if they see us but they might stop and grab us dont tell me you never thought of that before but when the train came closer mohammed was overwhelmed by fear and ran off coward weakling ill finish this holy war by myself jan raged and grabbed the next grenade the train soon reached the determined terrorist and the engineer already shaken up by the big explosions saw how he was loading his weapon on the side of the river the engineer decided to keep going fast and try to bring himself and his passengers to safety irritated jan turned around and aimed his weapon threateningly at the passing train materialistic pigs he hissed the passengers stiffened with fear when they saw him standing there except for one man dressed in a long brown robe who seemed to look right through him in the name of the prophet who is that creepy character jan thought and he quickly turned away the train gradually disappeared into the night the fighter went back to his work and shot the umpteenth oil tank to smithereens six storage tanks had been destroyed by now and the burning oil was trickling into the river michel opened his eyes and pensively scratched his nose thats what you call throwing oil on the fire and he made a note in his notebook then he got up with some difficulty and walked to the kitchen where he heated up some more milk religion without science is blindness he stated while filling up his cup and he sat down at his desk christophe suddenly came rushing in i have two hot messages for you sir okay lets have them the scholar sighed sliding deeper into his chair what do you want first the good news or the bad news you choose christophe then ill start with the bad news barbe regnault from paris has imitated your first part of the prophesies and published it he is committing plagiarism by doing this and i advice you to take him to court in paris im sure no one takes regnault seriously and what is the good news the queen is taking a trip through the south of france and she wants to come and visit you that is indeed good news his master smiled with your permission her majesty will visit on the eighteenth of next month can i send her a confirmation absolutely that will be the crown on my work accompanied by loud trumpet sounds the impressive royal procession went up the hill to where salon de provence was situated hundreds of mounted guards were riding in front of the coaches and a similar number behind them the city guards had blocked off all the roads with fences and thousands of people had gathered behind these the parade slowly moved through the city walls and finally amidst a lot of pushing and shoving came to a halt at the narrow place de la poissonnerie michel youve got company anne joked while the children waited lined up in the entrance hall christophe and the maid quickly brushed their clothes off holy smokes i didnt know she would come with such an enormous entourage michel thought looking through the window and with his wife he walked to the front door catherine de medici was getting out of her golden coach and a throng of courtiers followed in her wake hello doctor if you dont come to see me i will come to see you the queen greeted him your majesty i am so honored by your visit he laughed and he kissed her outstretched hand this must be your wife catherine supposed anne nodded and curtsied may my people come in but of course your majesty he answered upon which the queen and her entire noble following entered the house psst michel this is going to be a problem anne whispered theyre not nearly all going to fit into the guest house but her husband wasnt worried about it at all and sat down in one of the armchairs in front of the fireplace along with her highness her retinue gathered around them francis please come and sit with us catherine requested the young king who had been completely unnoticed until then obeyed his mothers wish and a valet brought a chair closer you know of course that my son is officially the king but since he is only fifteen years old i will have to rule for a while yet everyone looked at the king to see what his reaction would be but there wasnt any instead some of the courtiers gave him some compliments about his appearance the delicatelooking francis was indeed dressed magnificently he was wearing a tall beret decorated with golden tassels and a blue feather a black and red palace coat and a large white collar i had the honor of meeting your majesty a long time ago at le louvre nostradamus broke the impasse um yes i remember the teenager stuttered we spent the whole day walking through all the rooms the host explained francis ii was absolutely not suitable to rule the country and all present were aware of this though no one would ever say so his mother however was a leader extraordinaire all the ladiesinwaiting had to wear tight corsets in order to radiate more stylishness but she herself wore a noticeably loosefitting dress we would like to invite you to a dinner at the chateau de lempéri where we will spend the next few nights catherine announced phew thats one less logistics problem anne thought freed from her worry we gladly accept you invitation your majesty michel answered my father thought very highly of you the king suddenly blurted out thats nice to hear the host responded pleasantly surprised and who knew maybe it was even true and not only his father the queen said your advice was quite significant partly due to that i have been able to preserve unity in our country the battle between the guises and colignys flared up with great intensity after my husbands death we are extremely grateful to you and would like to show our appreciation in the form of an allowance and various privileges furthermore we are bestowing upon you two honorary titles and i herewith designate you as royal physician and advisor and she handed him the documents i very much appreciate this your majesty and he showed his gratitude with a deep bow after this tribute the queen and all the courtiers left for the nearby fort with the two tall towers the legendary procession disappeared out of sight and tranquility returned its like a fairytale being married to you anne said when she was alone with her husband again and nothing could ruin his day after that the last evening of the royal visit had already arrived michel and anne proceeded to the chateau de lempéri to bid a festive farewell to catherine de medici after a scintillating meal with musical accompaniment the laureate astrologer took a short walk with her through the courtyard im already looking forward to our next meeting doctor catherine revealed thats not going to happen your majesty this is the last time you will see me alive that makes me very sad she responded feeling a bit shocked and very moved she said goodbye to her special confidant so ended the queens historic visit1564 to salon de provence and life once again returned to normal the very first school in town was opened paul césar and madeleine were among its students and learned skills that would stand them in good stead in the future such as bookkeeping law and grammar sometimes old greek and latin texts were read to them but for the average student this was very dry and boring and the only one who had any interest in them was césar he was a keen student and was also the only one who loved poetry and recitation one day he asked his father if he could help him with his speech in english i dont know much english he answered but the main thing is that you have to really believe in what youre saying otherwise it will not have any potency maybe christophe can help you the youth immediately went up to the attic where the clerk was taking care of the international correspondence early that evening nostradamus was sitting on the sofa absorbed in thought when his wife came home after having done some shopping im back im busy my little sunshine he said floating in those other realms okay ill be quiet and she put away some new things in the cupboard then she surreptitiously placed a bonbon on the salon table for him ill put your pastis in the kitchen she couldnt refrain from telling him wonderful he thanked her from among the information streams he was receiving occult monomaniacs honor the dead and show their powers at the games jerusalem again causes dissension hmm pagan sects and the promised land but i dont see an agreement yet his wife meanwhile was making some disturbing noises she was moving the furniture around anne has christophe gone home already yes hes gone you can go and use his room if you want to michel slowly stood up saw the bonbon on the table and put it in his mouth what are you doing with those armchairs he asked smacking his lips im putting them next to the cabinet but why i just need a change i dont like things always the same i think you just want to get rid of me he said bluntly not at all i even put a treat there for you yes all the more reason youve got too much energy maybe you should start horsebackriding again absolutely not i may be twenty years younger than you but im getting older too and besides i still have to take treatments from the last time i fell that time with angelique he knew that when anne talked that way there was no changing her mind the grand master started up the stairs with his tail between his legs on the way up he had to stop to catch his breath several times the images kept flowing through his sixth sense his thirst for destruction will increase and his followers spread out over the continent like jumping flees bubbled up in him now the pain in his body had been getting worse lately his joints felt like they were on fire on a regular basis now and when he arrived in his workroom he had to immediately lie down and rest on the meditation bed my material vehicle can no longer handle my spirit he observed somberly and then bang he was blown out of his body the pain disappeared momentarily and he was in seventh heaven but the higher worlds carried him to another destination the minister of external affairs wanted to stretch his legs and pushed his chair back into the sitting position in the corridor the scent of fried eggs lingered and he decided to walk to the forecastle in the seethrough dome right underneath the cockpit his translator was enjoying the view of the atlantic ocean which was steadily sliding past underneath the airplane you had a long sleep jim said when he noticed his boss yeah well i needed it donald yawned stretching his arms i want to start the talks in good form you will probably come to a consensus yes probably with the europeans and the russians but well have to wait and see about the arabs can you pour me some more juice please he asked a passing stewardess jim had another coffee and again took pleasure in the view it feels like youre a bird flying over the sea he said but donalds thoughts were elsewhere and he didnt hear him i think i can see france over there the translator remarked a few minutes later france oh yes the ever troublesome little brother of the united states the minister grumbled the airplane was nearing the coast and began to descend to just above sea level why are we flying so low jim asked well be above enemy territory soon and this way they wont have time to shoot at us his boss explained you mean the muslims yes over here but in this country everyone does whatever they feel like doing since the rise of that chyren selin democracy has been eroded and the european laws are no longer being followed i sure hope they dont start shooting at us jim said feeling scared dont worry this boeing has regenerating parts that are full of sensors the microelectronics ensure that practically every bullet hole is closed within a few minutes only if theres a missile impact will we be in trouble missile impact yes they sometimes fire missiles from the alps thats where all the fanatic nationalists are but that wont happen above bretagne will it no but you never know the airplane was now flying above ile de france and the former light city came into view hey thats the eiffel tower isnt it yes you got that right that pile of rust is still standing despite all the bombings the airplane slowed down and upanddownmoving wings made of selfbending metal ensured a vertical landing with a onehour delay the jet landed in the safe zone of paris which had been completely sealed off from its rebel suburbs for several years after the wings had been retracted into the planes body they taxied to a hangar in the movable gangway the passengers took place on hanging seats in order to be carried to the right exit in the building via a pipe complex an identification scan ensured that the luggage was automatically delivered to the rightful owner after which everyone was checked again by a reallive official the american minister and his colleagues were picked up by the president of france good to see you again donald the latter greeted him likewise louis have the other delegates arrived yet theyre already sitting at the table any news no were not going to start until youve joined us the high officials got into an armored vehicle and rode to the center of paris with police escorts isnt that le louvre donald asked along the way yes it is louis confirmed despite the fact that its lost its position as museum it is still wellmaintained in the twelfth century it was a fort that was supposed to protect paris from outside attacks history seems to be repeating itself after arrival in the highly protected government building the group was taken to an underground office where panoramas depicting waterfalls cheered the walls the negotiators of the european union russia and arabic confederation were sitting at the conference table waiting for the latecomers the president of france immediately opened the summit talks we have gathered here in order to prevent escalation of the evergrowing gap between islamic and nonislamic population groups then you will first have to acknowledge chyren selin as one of our leaders the arabic diplomat alatwa instantly interrupted him you mean that french muslim with his three bickering wives ivanov the spokesman for russia sneered the meeting had barely begun and the delegates were already at each others throats holstein the chairman of the european union offered some assistance we dont mind acknowledging chyren selin but he will have to order his followers to respect our laws first such as equal rights for homosexuals and women our leader is prepared to make concessions provided that the europeanrussian fleet is removed from our holy city of mecca alatwa replied to this that fleet is there strictly because of a dispute with the government of saudiarabia holstein explained for the umpteenth time gentlemen please keep your heads cool we will all benefit from that the american minister tried to calm the parties down as far as you americans are concerned the only thing that matters is economic interest holstein decried but thats not what will get us out of this mess europe has been torn asunder and anarchy reins in large parts of it europe has never been able to take care of itself donald moaned and the us has they are the ones who impetuously invaded afghanistan and iraq way back then since that time there has not been one step towards world peace alatwa remarked that was twenty years ago weve learned our lesson since then such as well we still support the attack on afghanistan because that was done purely out of life preservation but as far as iraq is concerned i admit that the us made an error in judgment in retrospect the iraqi population was not happy with our presence there the president again made an attempt to force a breakthrough and again addressed the arab delegation chyren selin is capable of reining in all of the islamic insurgents in all of europe by giving one speech on tv he should take that one step he will do nothing as long as that fleet stays in the red sea alatwa repeated that fleet is there only to exert pressure to get bin laden handed over the president stressed we dont want war with the whole of the arab confederation under any circumstances an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us but why all that effort bin laden is an old man without any influence alatwa said dont try to fool us ivanov interrupted there are strong indications that he is your informal commander why dont you show us some proof of that then please stay calm gentlemen holstein appeased now if chyren is capable of getting his people to uphold our laws i think the european union is prepared to withdraw its ships but theres nothing we can do about the russian ships russia will not withdraw as long as saudiarabia does not fulfill its obligations and we want nothing to do with that french idiot with his three wives ivanov responded stubbornly chyren is not an idiot alatwa said angrily he is the peaceful guardian of islam the christians and the unbelievers they are the ones who are the idiots even more than that they are all criminals the wounds inflicted by the crusades colonization and imperialism have not been healed by any means this is going nowhere the russian mumbled then wed better end this meeting alatwa threatened and his colleagues already got up to leave suddenly all the lights went out and the panoramas disappeared it this some attempt to put pressure on us the arabs asked in the dark certainly not there must be a power outage the president apologized and he pressed the intercom button to report the problem strange thats not working either louis thought surprised one moment please gentlemen im sure this disturbance will be fixed momentarily and feeling his way he proceeded to the hall to ask for assistance to add insult to injury the entrance door wouldnt open due to electronic security and he carefully shuffled back to his spot at the table may i please borrow someones cell phone theyre not working donald answered he had already tried to make a call what on earth is going on here louis wondered feeling totally embarrassed the arab delegation was now getting restless it is evident that someone is playing games at our expense alatwa concluded absolutely not the president denied vehemently probably the americans an arab colleague supposed the americans are confederates nothing more in this country they have no power the president guaranteed having found his way back to his place at the table what we want is to prevent a third world war donald said what man desires is not always what happens alatwa replied to that gods decisions are unfathomable quote from alghazali from the year eleven hundred on the contrary god gave us brains so that we can solve our own problems holstein said scornfully i knew it three against one the egyptian heckled then the light returned and the panoramas became visible again but not a drop of water flowed down the mountain sides anymore what kind of joker has been playing with that film louis thought irritated a maintenance supervisor came in and rushed to speak to him theres been a power outage but we dont know yet what caused it he told his boss privately the negotiators meanwhile were looking at the dried up waterfalls somewhat surprised well gentlemen the disturbance was temporary apparently the president declared but please remain seated because we still need to talk further about a nonattack treaty with respect to nuclear arms the european union will certainly support that holstein said immediately the americans and russians also agreed but the cornered arabs were not yet ready to cross the bridge whats in it for us alatwa asked tenaciously whats in it for you ivanov repeated annoyed no nuclear bombs on mecca just ordinary ones that does it the arab called out offended and his delegation had just begun to walk away from the table again when the lights went out once more no one could leave the room perhaps an intervention from above to bring us together the president suggested a nuclear war would mark the end of human civilization in its entirety well lets hope for the best then and that higher intelligence may prevail alatwa said calmed down some and after the power outage was repaired for the second time and the water was once again flowing from the cliffs an intention declaration was signed in which it was agreed not to use any nuclear weapons paul césar and madeleine came home late from school and flopped themselves down in various places in the living room just as father was passing by why are you walking with such difficulty dad they asked he hesitated for a moment wondering what to say your father is old and sick he finally had to tell them they couldnt believe what they were hearing but youre invincible césar protested but the kids who were growing up took a closer look at him and could see that indeed there was fragile old man standing in front of them dinners ready anne suddenly called out they all went to the kitchen where a steaming pot of onion soup was waiting for them with some bread and butter christophe joined them as well hot dinner tonight he asked surprised yes i decided to turn things around for a change anne replied her husband was the first one to take a piece of bread out of the basket and laboriously buttered it the children kept staring at him observing the stiffness in his movements whats the matter anne asked while she was looking for cutlery in the drawer dad is acting like a sick man césar answered your father is sixtythree years old he is the oldest man in town she explained how can a doctor be sick he can heal anyone cant he andré asked scientists dont have a solution for everything son father answered although man will find a technique in the future to prolong life quite drastically diane take those toys off the table mother interrupted how long will people be able to live then dad madeleine asked maybe as old as methuselah well id hate to have to listen to the old school master for a hundred years paul grumbled or be married to the same old pain in the neck for four hundred years pauline added well i see i can learn something from you kids but dont worry were not going to be around to see those things come about christophe didnt participate in the table discussion as usual and was quietly eating his soup id like to be a horse and run through the woods really fast pauline fantasized or fly like a bird césar joined in its all going to happen children because some day man will be able to travel through the air and across land and water at great speed through the air how will they glue feathers onto their arms or something paul asked i think you kids have read the myth of icarus at school havent you but anyway thats not how it will be think more of a coach with iron wings in which the horse is hidden but will the wings be attached to the horse césar asked such difficult questions youre asking no it will be a machine that will go up in the air but im not exactly sure how in any case man will make life more and more complicated but in my dreams i can fly without any wings yes but in the dream world there is no gravity paul argued actually there is the more pure you are the lighter you become and if you are very pure you can look around everywhere distance time high level or low level dont play any role then oh thats why the bad guys are always in the underworld césar understood at once they sink down exactly sometimes all the way to the center of the earth in their sleep everyone ends up in their own circle and during the day they again feel the need to look for their equals a vicious circle unless man conquers his own ego you have to find a way to dislodge your anchors in hell you do this by becoming a good person becoming a bad person is very easy and can happen quite rapidly you all know the story about the fallen archangel dont you lucifer he fell down very deeply in one second well i still think one of those flying machines sounds like a lot of fun paul said michel liked that little bit of impertinence in his sons character at some point i will do some research on it paul he therefore promised the somber mood had lifted and the meal ended on a positive note im going upstairs to work for an hour or so the softspoken clerk said to his boss who was just sitting down in a chair by the fireplace the kids had gone to play outside except for diane who was looking at a picture book by the window anne was giving instructions to the maid in the kitchen and when she was done she sat down beside her husband diane would you mind leaving us alone for a while she asked and the girl obediently went into the garden the children were so worried about you is there something wrong michel didnt say anything just looked at his wife intensely i will not live to see this coming spring he answered finally anne realized that he was utterly serious and a big tear slid down her cheek we still have some time before that i dont know if i can live without you she sobbed when the time comes you will be able to handle it he tried to console her and they held each other for a while after this moving moment he decided to get back to work and went up to the attic so christophe what urgent matters are keeping you busy up here he asked while catching his breath from climbing the stairs your publisher in london has asked me to translate your latest almanac into english his own translator is making a mess of it suddenly nostradamus began to shake uncontrollably whats wrong master no its nothing dont worry about me the third world war is about to begin and he grimly walked to the window youre doing an exceptionally good job christophe he said while looking out at the evening twilight but how much longer will it take you im practically finished the secretary replied applying the last few pen strokes i cant see anything going on in the sky yet the clairvoyant thought to himself shall i clean up those longnecked bottles christophe asked as he was leaving sorry i didnt hear you i was absorbed in my thoughts i was just asking if you wanted me to put those bottles away you havent touched them in years oh yes thats fine nostradamus answered while he kept staring out the window have a nice evening and ill see you tomorrow master and with a few bottles under his arm the clerk left then the sky was suddenly littered with monstrous inventions and the air turned black a horrific war was being carried out right before michels eyes the violence was unprecedented it was raining milk steel fire and pestilence and many nations met their death the exorbitant amount of violence even caused earthquakes and rivers extended their courses world trade completely collapsed and people were suffering from enormous hunger and thirst the antichrist was not one person but rather an automated cold world which had now come to an end the seer could see through all the ages at a glance and everything looked excruciatingly bare wherever he focused his vision all was revealed to him it would take many dozens of years before life on earth would be repaired enough to create a new world order aquarius would begin a millennium of peace in which man would pay attention to the sky and to outer space due to new insights into the relationship between our planet and the universe the old scriptures would be reinterpreted religion and science would finally merge together then a coordination government would be installed to rule the entire world and from that time on people would all cooperate with each other nevertheless much damage was done to the earth and an irreversible process was set in motion the planet would be plagued by floods for centuries and after that by extreme droughts for just as long michel lit a candle and sat down at his desk the sun had set by now he opened his writing book and wrote down all that had been revealed to him suddenly the flame of his candle began to flutter back and forth and he knew that something or someone must have entered the room he turned around and saw his wife standing in the doorway would you like to make love with me she asked tenderly the divine request completely softened his heart again without answering he blew out the candle and together they went downstairs to their bedroom after the enchantment in bed the next vision immediately presented itself the doorbell rang and ping hurriedly finished putting on her makeup and ran outside good morning miss lee please get in the instructor who was wearing a pair of large yellow goggles requested she walked around the flying car which soundlessly hovered above the ground and came dangerously close to the wings which were moving up and down more rapidly than they eye could perceive watch out you could really hurt yourself on those the teacher warned sitting down on the other side exciting she said as she fastened her seatbelt flying is in fact very simple practically everyone knows how is this your first lesson yes mister norton and i dont know anything about it at all while she examined the interior you may call me unix he said as he scribbled some notes youre in luck ping you are getting your lesson in a brand new flying car and its the lightest model not counting the water tank it only weighs four hundred and thirteen kilos but it is strong enough right she asked of course it meets all the regulations and when he flicked a leaver the seethrough top closed automatically we will have to fly out of new water first because beginners are no longer permitted to practice in the city and using the extra steering mechanism he brought the vehicle high above the inner city and into the sweltering sky well go to the bering plateau you can make as many mistakes as you want to there im not that dumb she responded pertly standard joke he apologized and they flew to the expansive practice area once they got there he brought the flying car to a stop high above the salt plateau now im switching the controls over to you ping do you prefer telepathic or verbal instructions verbal please all right the most important thing is the control stick you can move it up and down in and out and from left to right yes i know im just starting at the beginning next to the control stick are the foot pedals the right pedal is for accelerating and the left one is for a straight descent if you dont do anything the machine will just hang in the air and stay in the same spot okay now you take the wheel while i take care of the pedals ping moved the control stick forward and the machine immediately tipped its nose downward see he said were just staying in the same place because im not stepping on the gas pedal but now im going to just a bit and the flying car began to slowly descend now pull the control stick back or well have an accident she did as he asked and the machine pulled its nose up and found its height again now turn left and then right he ordered she tried it and made a few sharp turns now youre going to step on the gas at the same time and his student made the machine fly above the platform by fits and starts look someones walking over there she said suddenly and she tapped the window to point him out who ever would be walking around here unix wondered surprised he must be lost youd better go over there and she got the flying car to go in the right direction albeit a little clumsily youre learning pretty fast at the end of this lesson day youll be able to fly he praised her in the meantime they were approaching the mortal in the long brown robe who was making his way across the parched surface all alone judging by the way hes walking he is a longlife ping guessed you could be right because an intelligent being would not be walking around in this vicinity let me take over the controls from you for a minute and he managed to maneuver the soundless machine to right next to the plodding eccentric then he slid open the roof so he could call out to him can we help you the loner just about jumped out of his skin he was so startled and uselessly began to flee thats got to be a longlife acting like that unix laughed hes probably from the melting factory at the south pole ping suggested thats almost impossible he would have had to travel thousands of kilometers sad that their ancestors had their genes messed with in the old days they wanted to live forever so badly they forgot to consider the negative aspects of it it only became clear after they had kids nowadays the only thing theyre good for is melting ice and even then they get in the way ping joked except this one i will alert the authorities of dutch harbor he said and after contacting them he continued the lesson after a few exercises his student was really getting the hang of flying and it was time for a bigger challenge now were going to look for air currents well leave the passable flying routes alone for a few more lessons and he instructed her to turn around off to the pacific ocean or whats left of it he joked and they flew southward at a speed of five hundred kilometers an hour a little while later the coast appeared theres a free area with a lot of air currents around the emperor archipelago he informed her is that what i should fly to if you can but look around you all the time ping dont rely on the radar too much i never saw any radar yet she responded and he had to swallow hard check all the meters too he then urged a red light is on she said right away man that thing runs out of fuel so fast he grumbled that light means were low on fuel go ahead and go down to one meter above sea level so i should let go of the gas pedal first right correct he confirmed ping took her foot off the gas pedal and pushed down on the other pedal to descend the flying car shot down immediately when they got close to the sea she abruptly let go of the pedal and they came to a standstill with a shock dont worry it has an automatic speed limiter he reassured her and anyway the machine is waterproof unix then piloted the car right down to the water level himself now press the purple button and the vacuum will do the rest incidentally did you know that starting in january youre only allowed to put a hundred liters of seawater in your tank no i didnt realize that she replied i do feel guilty that im now going to be contributing to the evaporation of the oceans yup everyone wants his own car and melting ice at the poles is not enough to keep the sea level up so were going to have to be more frugal after all what can we expect with something like a billion airplanes in the air all burning water for years and the drought continues rain is seen as a gift from heaven these days ive never even seen rain ping said while the instruments gave a signal that the tank was full again well just a drop too bad for you its a beautiful sight okay now go straight to those islands and the flying car picked up speed again were robbing the planet down to nothing unix harped on people thought burning water for fuel was the solution for the fuel problem but now we are literally and figuratively drying up there is a plan for condensing moisture from the air on a large scale she commented that will never work before we reach that little island over there i want you to climb to two thousand feet on course 315 the wind is blowing at twenty knots from the northeast and you always have to take the wind into consideration ping translated the technical jargon pulled the control stick back and stepped on the gas it seemed to be the right thing to do and he gave her a few more tasks to perform around the group of islands youve carried out everything to my satisfaction he said finally lets fly due north again and increase the rpm to 1800 and they returned to the bering platform the time had flown by and the sun was disappearing into the stale atmosphere did you hear that mabus space ship is leaving for mcharek next week he asked when they got back over land yes of course ive been following every minute of it a hundred men and women are going and its going to take them thirty years to get there ping said while keeping her eye on the indicators the livable planet is popularly already being called the little prince because its circumference is only half of that of the earth he continued less than half yes a bit smaller i suppose colonization of mcharek is the solution for our drought problem our terrestrial globe is just pretty much rundown some pessimists are predicting that we will only be able to be here for another half a century before humanity will perish because of the scorching heat they also say im getting distracted unix im tired she interrupted him and he took over the controls what do you think about paying a short visit to the komandorski top he suggested the space ship is moored above it and were going right past it anyway great idea ping replied at least she could relax now he increased their speed and a little while later they arrived at the famous mountain top on the ochotsk plain where a supertall elevator between the earth and space had been built the cable stood up straight due to the centrifugal force they flew around it for a while from here they will enter space next month he said i would love to travel along on that sun powered ship with those great sails id rather stay right here on earth you dont know what youre saying the whole world is getting bleaker every day almost nothing grows here anymore i still love earth women are so sentimental he thought they flew around the elevator which reached to outside of the earths atmosphere and then turned back towards new water i see that longlife is still wandering around down there ping discovered when they crossed the southern point of the salt plain ill report him one more time he said and they flew up along the ring way well its more difficult than i thought it would be she admitted when she got dropped off at home youre doing really well unix praised her again but the most difficult part is still to pass the theory exams ill cross that bridge when i get to it i guess see you next week and she slammed the front door shut behind her it was early in the morning and annes bare back was roguishly sticking up out of the blankets from his side of the bed michel stared at her strong shoulders covered by her messy locks which were still goldenbrown she was still asleep and although she was an enticing sight he was feeling too restless to stay in bed any longer he covered up her back and got up the weather was cold and gloomy and as he walked down the stairs his joints were creaking like an old cart downstairs in the living room he immediately lit the fire to chase the dampness out of the house while he was rubbing his eyes with his crooked fingers he heard a dull bang the sound came from the garden side and the old scientist decided to go and see what had caused it he walked into the courtyard across the veranda behind the living room and saw a sparrow lying on the ground dazed poor little wretch you thought you could fly through the window didnt you but now it has glass in it humans are creating confusion everywhere he looked at the sparrow for a while it didnt seem to be able to pull itself together then he went inside and in the kitchen he poured some water into a little bowl and dunked some sage into it back in the courtyard he carefully picked up the little bird he opened its beak and dribbled a few drops of the elixir into its mouth the bird came to and startled to see those big human hands began to thrash about whoa im the doctor he whispered and placed the sparrow in a corner where it could relax when he bent down he suddenly had a gout attack and huge waves of pain shot through all his joints it was unbearable and he crawled into the house on his hands and knees anne had risen in the meantime and was just coming down the stairs unsuspecting when she noticed her husband sitting curled up on the couch where is the pain she asked worried everywhere he moaned but especially in my left knee she carefully removed his slipper and sock but even the light touch on the rotting leg made him tremble it doesnt do any good to look at it he whined i have to see it for a minute and she rolled up his pant leg around the deformed knee joint she saw purple swollen skin that does not look good she thought and she felt his pulse his heartbeat was extremely fast she ran to the kitchen and mixed some painkilling herbs with a good quantity of alcohol drink this she ordered when she returned michel drank the glass down and the drink did him some good the attack subsided im going to go out and pick lavender with the kids in a minute and then i am going to rub it all over your body she informed him the kids were up now too and césar and madeleine were going to help their mother they left for the fields with a straw basket to pick the herb that had a healing effect on rheumatism they had to search for a while because the herb with its greygreen leaves only grew on steep hills during this season once the basket was full they quickly returned home christophe had arrived in the meantime and together they dragged the scholar up the stairs for the third time anne wanted to undress her husband on the bed but the faithful servant was still there you go now christophe she commanded and he reluctantly left the room the old scientist was now lying naked on his stomach and his wife sat down across him then she began to rub the calming herb into his body from the top of his head down to his toes as she was moving her hands gradually down his body she came across some gout bumps under the skin which he had not mentioned before the morbid growths felt awful after the massage she covered him up carefully you might start to feel sleepy she said he thanked her but she couldnt understand his mumbling and left the room during the next few days she repeated the treatment twice a day and the whole house smelled like lavender his health was improving weeks after the fearsome blow he was able to move through the house very slowly and he exchanged a few words with his kids all was well for about a month when winter set in however he collapsed and he only got through the days with the utmost effort he hurriedly called a notary public and he secretly made up his will the same behavior as my father he thought sadly when the official man left with his wishes on paper nostradamus had now retreated permanently to the attic and worked on his main work the prophesies until he was no longer able to just one more verse and that will be it he thought when he had finished the tenth century he suddenly became unwell and tumbled backwards there he was lying on the floor and quietly but with a clear mind he stared up at the ceiling his life on earth came to an end and lying next to his spyglass he breathed his last breath a desolate plane with a sweltering sky spread out before him is this heaven where my soul must find peace nostradamus seriously wondered but this really did not look like the promised paradise and he tried to figure out what it was one thing was sure his spirit had not left him because he still had aspirations it was scorching hot here the sun was shining brightly and was larger than ever before in the distance he could see the sea and the innumerable shells in the sand told him that seawater used to flow here in the past the sea had dried up for miles to the south this looks like camargue in the future he surmised just above the skyline he detected a sign of life it seemed to be growing it slowly dawned on him that it was a machine that was zooming towards him and a few moments later a flying car stopped right in front of him the seethrough sunroof slid open and a man wearing large yellow goggles and a chinese girl appeared can we help you the man said in a friendly way but the seer didnt get a chance to answer the question because just at that moment a large comet passed the earths atmosphere the three mortals turned all of their attention to the flaming colossus which was approaching earth with staggering speed the exhausted earth planet had somehow attracted the comet and it seemed like her congener was coming to help just in time they all knew that something terrible was about to happen and looked at each other with expressions of bewilderment michel estimated that the chunk of rock would hit about one thousand kilometers from where they were when that happened the impact was overwhelming and the planet creaked in all its joints it felt like an assault to ones own body the flood is coming they all realized the catastrophic attack on mother earth made them realize who they had to thank for their existence but it was too late for humility or repentance the gods had decided to separate the chaff from the wheat and to mow everything down to nothing the two companions in misfortune in the flying car stared ahead blankly and waited for what was to come the rotating earth which had been moving around automatically until then slowed down and everyone held their breath my god the disappearance of the ice from the poles can lead to unbalance michel murmured his spoken words came true immediately and the earths axis began to topple the planet began to whirl out of control because of the changing interplay of forces on the celestial body it wasnt long before there were earthquakes and erupting volcanoes everywhere the flying car was still zooming steadily above the ground but the people inside it were looking around frantically now it began to vibrate dangerously under nostradamus feet and suddenly the sea roared a tidal wave was coming towards them at breakneck speed the two aviators sped off in their machine the seer managed to avoid the wall of water on his own power by launching himself high up into the air the sky in the meantime was getting murky the sun moon and stars disappeared behind clouds of dust water and fire it was time to flee to a safer haven soon ill run out of energy and ill plunge into the ocean michel worried my soul is all i have left what am i saying im forgetting to mention my memories and counting his blessings he flew towards the northern mountains at high speed to take shelter among them on the way he became aware of the horrific disaster that was taking place on earth abnormal storms raged across land and sea and airplanes fell down like autumn leaves towns and villages turned into piles of rubble and ships were being devoured by skyhigh waves a desperate fear took hold of all the peoples on the earth and many died just from the fear nothing and nobody could stand up against this force of nature and it only kept getting worse no place was spared chunks of the earth burst apart or bumped into each other with intense force and thick layers of molten stone were forming new mountains and chasms here and there the forces of the heavens kept moving and an abundant rain that had been saved up for years began to fall in no time countries that had been drying up were flooded by the rainwater a handful of space ships were trying to get to outside of the earth atmosphere with the assistance of a laser beam god why are you so merciless michel asked while he watched everything from a great height and then he was hit by lighting he fell down many miles in shock but landed alive in a valley that seemed to be yet untouched i doubted him he realized shaken and as a snake that had to crawl on his belly as punishment he fled into the mountains the seawater kept rising and the valley filled up in order to keep his head above the water he had to take shelter on a mountain he seemed to be safe there for a little while but suddenly the valley burst open and red magma spewed up out of holes and crevices the confrontation between the lava and the water caused an earsplitting hissing sound poisonous gasses and glowing hot steam rose up and threatened the hurrying ghost who had to keep climbing higher and higher this is getting to be hopeless he thought and with the force of desperation he kept scrambling up the sheer rock walls again there were explosions which this time caused an enormous squall and he had to hang on to the wall with all his might with a spark of hope he climbed on a short while later a powerful explosion collapsed the sides of several mountains but miracle of miracles left his path unharmed however he could not see any future for himself and wondered where it would all end up defeated he reached the top where he watched the end of time on the horizon the flood was now at its peak and there was no longer any clear distinction between heaven and earth mountain ranges disappeared into ravines and angry seas shot up into the air trails of clouds were sucked through holes only to spit out again right away why is this mountain the only one that is staying put in this swirling mass he wondered did i become one already and for a moment he thought he was gods equal oops mental derangement thats all i need now he understood after some introspection the illusion had just barely been fought off when something nasty crawled close to him from behind it penetrated into all his fibers and a thousand shivers ran down his back well are you enjoying the view a velvet voice with an iron heart suddenly spoke the mountain top petrified and the air became bleak with shaking knees michel turned around and saw someone standing there it was lucifer the fallen archangel you have been my best student so far he continued many wise people on earth think they can fathom me but such frivolity is foreign to you the chief devil radiated an intense black energy and this sucked up the last of the weakened prophets energy there were ten horns on satans head but suddenly another one poked through and the others made room for it he could pulverize his victims effortlessly with his large bronze claws and iron teeth anything left would be trampled under his feet his strong wings also told that escape would be impossible you have done me some very special favors he feigned again you are the greatest sinner ever and an enormous glow of pride shone from his eyes while two crows flew up to land on his shoulders his words did not really get through to the mortal because he was just noticing that his own heart felt like a lump of ice you have uttered disastrous curses with your predictions lucifer explained while a piece of a hops plant was growing out of his mouth what me michel stuttered completely flabbergasted yes you even this flood was started by you i have had great plans for you from the beginning your talent cannot be denied granted i had to give you a little push every once in a while and he bit off the growing plant and chewed on it what what are you talking about and as a reward you get to finally meet your master lucifer said ignoring his question and pointing to himself now i have a proposal you worship me and in exchange i will give you all of my worldly wisdom that will put me on the wrong path what you think my proposal is not good enough for you lucifer screeched and his voice reverberated all around them all right and he took a few steps forward his student meanwhile was looking around in a panic thinking of a way to fly away that wont do you any good lucifer hissed reading his thoughts effortlessly i always vanquish my enemies their power is my fuel and the desperate ghost let go of his plan i am supremely powerful i teased you on top of the etna and i was suddenly on the cover of your book or i conjured a nice little flame in your living room i was always with you everywhere and i know more about what goes inside of you than you do you want to save souls but be realistic no one will help you and you barely have the capacity to fly away and look around you you have no choice michel considered for a moment if he could hide in his earthly body ha ha forget it your body is already decomposed there is nothing left to crawl into lucifer said immediately every thought was caught instantly and in silence the mortal prayed to god oh god god is okay with everything no matter if youre alive or dead i on the other hand bring light your reputation and your clairvoyance are all thanks to me if i had not made your previous family die of the plague you would have been nothing but a local little doctor michel couldnt believe what he was hearing and seriously considered letting himself be led to the chopping block the only thing i want from you is cooperation the light carrier now revealed every little bit helps and together we are strong dont be so sentimental life goes on you know your wife already has her eye on claude de tende you know that governor and your offspring theyre all happy theyre finally out from under your thumb in the name of jesus christ michel suddenly cried out you want to bring him into this too you sure dont learn fast jesus will not help you hes walking around in circles somewhere chasing his own tail nostradamus fell onto his knees in misery and brought his predictions into his mind did i really cause all those disasters yes but its okay i can turn it back if i feel like it only under one condition though and that is that you surrender to me i loathe you all right ill sweeten the pot a little more what do you think about this in addition to getting all my insights you may also return to your wife with a healthy body michel was being provoked to the nth degree and the temptation was so strong that he almost succumbed but fortunately he remembered the most important thing oh you and that infernal soul of yours stop being so smallminded and think bigger for a change lucifer complained stepping closer his victim was picking himself up and saw the devils face coming nearer it was so horrific he involuntarily shrank back from it have i misjudged you after all lucifer raged is this the gratitude im going to get from you and i even sent hermes to clean your inner stables of augias are you really such a simple soul to stay stuck in that petty way of thinking i could have left that to any of my simple helpers you only have power on earth humanity will surpass you his student suddenly protested do you mean that handful of idiots that is trying to fly into outer space a minor flaw nobodys perfect they however are doomed to die or to roam aimlessly in space for eternity you see a new ice age is beginning here and im getting bored of you nos the ruler of darkness was standing very close now and looked at him with contempt then the holy fire ignited in michels heart his fears disappeared and he raised his head and said if there was ever anyone who always met evil headon it was probably me but i am not evil i will never sell my soul to you the two crows suddenly took flight from lucifers shoulders and he bolted towards the apostate and pushed him into the abyss then burn in hell forever satan called after him and michel fell down into the redhot lava streams france was in deep mourning after the death of its illustrious compatriot and everyone had their flag out at halfmast the prominent officers poured into salon de provence from far and wide to pay their last respects to the seer under the auspices of the family the physical remains were buried in the church of the cordeliers while a priest was holding the sermon the coffin was placed into the memorial tomb with the public watching anne was standing in the front with her children nervous about the proceedings her ancient brothersinlaw were standing behind her the memorial tomb had been placed straight up inside the wall as per nostradamus request so that his enemies would not be able to step on his throat after the deceased had been blessed the tomb was closed and anne briefly touched the stone lid in which her husbands portrait was carved at eye height the image showed him at the age of about fortynine his coat of arms was also on there then she sadly kneeled in front of the grave and read the text on the marble commemorative stone which she had written herself and which she had arranged to have placed below it the words were etched in latin michaelis nostradami ummortaliu after that everyone sat down on the church benches and the governor of the provence spoke a few final words dear family and friends claude said with a lump in his throat the world has lost a very special person during the last few days a person who at the beginning of his career as physician managed to save thousands of citizens from the plague and who later allowed us a glimpse into the future through his unprecedented prophesies despite his impertinence michel de nostredame was a very pious man he was never intimidated by anyone or anything on the contrary he walked gods path with confidence and defied many dangers but aside from his inimitable talent and tenacity he was also a loving father and all eyes turned to the six children who had been keeping very quiet all this time claude continued i once had to much against my own will incarcerate my friend by superior orders but when he was free again he never held it against me this made a great impression on me i admired him greatly and who didnt the governor then addressed his buried friend michel if there is someone who has shown the right example of what the lord expects of us it is you may your soul find peace the widow burst into tears after those last words and claude went to her to comfort her then he offered his condolences to the six children and the brothersinlaw and everyone followed his example when the dignitaries friends and other important guests had all expressed their sympathies they left the church claude and anne exchanged a few thoughts ive been so rude to him anne sniffled he deserved a better wife youre being too hard on yourself you really were his pride and joy claude soothed her laying a protective arm around her shoulder the rest of the relatives were now also coming out of the church and the children were all standing there looking a little lost well id better go anne said those six need me or else i need them if you need someone to talk to dont hesitate to come and see me claude offered thats very sweet of you but im sure ill be fine and they all left the church of the cordeliers which would be closed for an indefinite period of time the next day anne received hundreds of letters of sympathy from all over the country including one from the queen with the assistance of christophe she would write a thank you note to everyone the notary public meanwhile contacted the widow and informed her that her late husband had recently made up a will in the presence of the children he presented it to her it turned out that michel had left his wife the enormous sum of more than 3444 crowns plus an individual amount for each child in the estate there was also a letter that was addressed especially to his son césar the young man who was sixteen by now felt honored to accept the letter and sat down with it on the veranda sitting in his fathers rocking chair he read the emotionally charged letter to my son césar may life and fortune be with you your late arrival gave me the opportunity to dedicate many of my night times to write that which i want to leave you after my passing into the other world these are my insights about the general purpose and progression of humanity which the higher authorities have given me they have been incorporated into the prophesies i feel i must write this letter although your delicate mind due to your tender age will not yet be able to understand their content all of my predictions will come about according to the stars but the adventures of humankind will be uncertain in their balance because everything is ultimately controlled by god himself astrology cannot determine human fate with any certainty only those with divine inspiration can reveal something real i was privileged to experience this divine inspiration and many of my predictions have come true in many parts of the country my messages however could fall into the wrong hands of future leaders who could misuse the prophesies or discard them which would emphasize the opposite this would undermine the development of mankind and for this reason i have hidden the prophesies in inimitable quatrains as the old saying goes do not cast pearls before swine i have therefore used obscure and disordered aphorisms in order not to damage the smallminded people in the present or the future sometimes i wish i could be silent yet i cant do anything but pass on my insights it would be a sign of carelessness from my side because the hidden messages will serve the course of humanity by showing them their place only initiates will be able to fathom the verses it is not for the average person to know the given times and moments in order to lead and protect the common folk the creator will repeatedly reveal the secrets of the future and the past to pure knowing ones revelations of the divine works that are perfect the capacity for clairvoyance is received from the tender soul of the fire which can be touched during the night rest the insights flowing from that must not be confused with the natural knowledge of the living beings the supernatural insights originate with the ethereal source and are kept hidden under the arch of heaven my son i pray that you will never lend your intelligence to dreams and trivialities that can dry up the higher bodies and allow the soul to ultimately get lost i have left my work room empty i have sacrificed my books full of secret wisdom to vulcanus in order to keep its dangerous power from the public when i burned the books the sky became unusually clear and that showed me it was a good decision god has favored me and i hope to be able to pass on my inspiration to you in spirit your father seems far away now but i am not removed further from heaven with my senses than i am from earth with my feet and dont praise me into heaven i am a sinner greater than any other but considering your tender mind i will stop myself from wandering further into that subject what i am leaving you is the prophesies the predictions in this book are related to the arch along which the moon moves i have discovered that before the earth is burned there will be such floods that every inch of ground will be under water humanity as we know it will ultimately cease to exist but dont be frightened by this doom scenario it will take centuries for that to happen and before that time i hope to have a chance to explain the verses to you in person may god grant you prosperity salon de provence became a popular place of pilgrimage hordes of people annually visited the legendary seers memorial tomb and every day some buzzing could be heard in the church of the cordeliers only at night did peace return and was there silence until 225 years later two superstitious soldiers would seriously disturb this ritual one night during the french revolution bruno and yves who were encamped nearby were hanging around the big fountain the inseparable duo was in need of some entertainment and they were talking and drinking you know what i dream of yves blustered one of those mounted castiron cannons brute force was brunos opinion i think sorcery is a lot more exciting than that and the bigger the barrel the more beautiful it is his friend prattled on you dont need a stupid canon man if you know some magic tricks what do you have some supernatural gifts yves asked while he passed the bottle of wine to his buddy no but do you have a canon bruno replied thinking himself smart his friend shrugged his shoulders and took another swig did you know bruno continued loudly that in paris the bastille with its eight towers and oneandahalf meters thick walls has been flattened to the ground and that it involved not even one canon heck i didnt know that his companion retorted tipsily and while they chattered on a window opened in one of the neighboring houses hey quiet down you guys a citizen of salon who was trying to sleep called out watch out or ill turn you into a frog bruno brushed him off and the neighbor grumbled something while he closed the shutter have you ever been to paris yves asked extra loudly no but have i ever been anywhere without you well get to paris yet the soldiers were bored to tears and were in the mood for some action yves you know nostradamus grave is nearby want to come see yves agreed and together they ambled towards the church of the cordeliers what do you want to do there its the middle of the night yves asked on the way im going to drink wine out of the skull of the prophet but why the story is going around that you could maybe get magical powers if you do that oh wow but you have to get inside first dont you yves smirked buddy just leave it to me and they walked around the church to the back door ill be right back bruno whispered conspiringly yves waited by the door until his friend came back with an iron bar using this the door was easily broken open and they snuck into the church in the front the two soldiers found the upright tomb of the seer and bruno had a look to see how to open the thing they had soon managed to remove the stone lid and between the old boards they saw the skeleton of nostradamus they violently ripped off its skull and a golden amulet fell to the bottom of the coffin unnoticed while bruno drank wine out of the skull his buddy started to juggle with the bones suddenly the brains behind the macabre plan felt himself being grabbed across the throat by invisible hands and with all his strength he tried to pull them off for a minute yves thought his friend was just kidding around but when he kept calling out for help and he began to turn purple yves ran away scared to death just past the sacristy a statue of a saint suddenly fell over right in front of him and he tripped over it and fell on the floor the mayor had heard the commotion in the church and ordered his city guards to grab the two burglars they were caught in the act and offered no resistance to their arrest bruno had almost choked to death and was still trying to catch his breath and yves was lying unconscious on the floor throw those soldiers into the lockup the furious mayor ordered well use them later at the frontthe battle of waterloo see the end of chapter 3 they can catch the enemys bullets for us then he walked over to the damaged tomb and discovered the golden medallion between the remainder of bones in the tomb when he saw the inscription on the ageold medallion his jaw dropped in surprise it had the number of the current year 1791 on it he hurriedly put the treasure back into the coffin which was shut again with all the bones inside a few minutes later the bewildered mayor then immediately ordered his men to transfer the grave to the church of saint laurent where it could be better taken care of he never spoke another word about it to anyone ever again henrik larson was happily walking through his vineyard under a cloudless sky bunches of grapes were hanging from the graceful vines and he pulled one off he bit the blue fruit in half and carefully tasted it yes its ripe he concluded the soursweet juice was just right for the preparation of the deepred drink and the harvest was ready to be brought in tomorrow i will gather some pickers he promised himself and with a feeling of satisfaction he looked over at his vines in the valley down by the river the flowing river water sparkled brightly in the late afternoon sun and he enjoyed the beautiful view above the horizon to the south were the silhouettes of the pyrenees their mighty presence was palpable here and their energies shimmered in the vineyard id better get home he thought looking at his watch and started to trudge up the hill behind which was cave lagneaux despite his swedish background he had become a popular man in this village in just a few years his open face was an invitation to anyone the philosophical larson had landed in limoux when during a purification journey he had met not himself but a french woman he had married her and they settled in the sundrenched district of aude with its picturesque villages and narrow roads they found an old farm that still had an old wine press and renovated it into its modern state the house had been furnished with all comforts over the years inside the walledin garden henrik had recently built a swimming pool for the children he walked towards cave lagneaux and breathed in the last scents of nature life can be so beautiful he thought as he went inside brigitte tomorrow i want to start picking he called and looked for his wife on the main floor he didnt see her anywhere and he was just about to go and look for her upstairs when a blonde woman came down the stairs halfway they bumped into each other hello angel youre so beautiful he greeted her it seemed like they hadnt seen each other in ages and they lovingly touched each other every day a new woman he thought in his head brigitte i want to bring in the harvest tomorrow okay ill make some phone calls tonight she said how many pickers do you think youll need i think five or six should be enough and they went to the living room to go over the days business your father called he will call back tonight brigitte reported while she picked up an address book ill call him now he replied hi dad david called out rushing out of the laundry room with a cat in his arms was mau hiding in there again dad asked the child nodded and went upstairs to his room without the cat the timer on the oven rang and the couple hurried to the kitchen where brigitte was trying out a new recipe you havent touched your easel in months she said as she pulled the hot dish out of the oven do you want me to put it away or are you going to make something beautiful soon just put it away i dont feel like painting anymore in a painting everything is so trapped it has no life anymore no id rather look at nature or at you she smiled at the compliment never tiring of his admiring remarks i still think the painting with the sunflowers is brilliant she confessed and she poked the vegetable quiche with a knife to see if it was done oh its a nice picture oh right i was going to call my father where is that cell phone in the cupboard with the mirror dear she answered and he went into the living room and youll call for some workers right he called after her he found the phone and quickly had his father in stockholm on the line hello dad i heard you called right i did your mother had a sudden unsettled feeling about you guys and asked me to give you a call the violence in europe is definitely on the increase its pretty safe in the country where we are his son reassured him lets hope so in any case were glad youre finally doing so well you seemed like the eternal martyr there for a while everything okay with brigitte and the kids yup everythings excellent fred is crawling around everywhere he can almost walk already and tomorrow were going to be bringing in the harvest beautiful and grateful work son unfortunately sweden is not a wine country and we are too old to come by but next year godwilling we are planning to come for a visit but wed better keep this short um they both said goodbye and henrik turned off the cell phone the only communication device in the house he had agreed with his wife that the children should be exposed to as few miseries and temptations as possible until their seventh year for that reason there was no computer and no television in the house dinner is ready brigitte called putting fred back into the playpen david and lisa came down the stairs the girl hopped to the eating corner with a pack of markers and quickly made another drawing while her brother followed her actions that doesnt look like anything he teased and provokingly pulled the paper away from her you jerk lisa shouted hey no namecalling around here her father warned he didnt see what was going on because he was just getting some glasses from the kitchen yeah but david is teasing and hes always being nasty to me his daughter whined and youre nasty back to him thats how you get stuck in a vicious cycle if you behave properly hell stop teasing you because it wont be any fun for him anymore lisa had heard the lecture but she was still angry with her little brother hell get run over by a car some day she said quietly but her father heard her those are dangerous thoughts lisa dont make predictions like that dont make any predictions in fact its like pronouncing a curse boys just act that way and they eventually outgrow that kind of behavior but i will keep a closer eye on david and he gave his son an intense look every once in a while those kids were a pain in the neck but for the most part they were good kids after the vegetable quiche had been devoured and the kids had gone to bed henrik was leafing through a thick book and making some notes what are you doing brigitte asked after she had done the dishes im giving a lecture about swedenborg at the cultural center next week he replied taking off his reading glasses any particular theme conjugal love i hope it wont get too mushy with all our acquaintances there i assume you wont be discussing our love life you know me better than that he assured her she picked up a magazine and sat down on the couch beside her husband a few minutes later she was sadly shaking her head theres been an attack on city hall in pau she told him any victims three dead including the mayor the climate in the country had been getting harsher during the last few years and they realized how vulnerable their own existence was but aside from being watchful they had faith in providence after brigitte had made a few phone calls they decided to go to sleep mother picked up fred from the playpen and together they went upstairs the little one still slept with his parents at dawn the next day the group of grape pickers walked to the southfacing vineyard above the valleys of the cathar regions hung a beautiful mystical mist that morning once in the vineyard henrik gave everyone a bucket and a knife to cut down the bunches of grapes the group consisted of three men from limoux a lost basque and two traveling girls from denmark the wooden cart that the full buckets had to be emptied onto was already in its spot okay everyone get to work their employer ordered and everyone quickly went to their own row oh and there are drinks for you next to the cart he called after them a little later the first buckets were being emptied and a drink of water was taken around nine oclock the boss wife brought a picnic and passed out baguettes and an assortment of cheese although it was still early in the day the frenchmen had a glass of wine with their bread and cheese the danish girls preferred simply water after the short interlude the picking was resumed the sun was getter brighter and the mist disappeared the warm sunrays on everyones skin made the work pleasant and they were singing and talking youll probably have a sore back for the first two days henrik warned the two ladies who had never done this kind of work before but they didnt take him seriously by eleventhirty the sun was so hot everyone was drenched in sweat fortunately it was getting to be lunch time and they all returned to cave lagneaux where an elaborate meal was waiting for them the pickers left their dirty shoes by the door and sat down in the eating corner which of you will be able to help us for the whole month henrik asked when he sat down at the table there is a lot of work to do the fruit still has to be sorted cleaned and pressed the four men said they could stay on but the danish girls wanted to continue their travels the group started to eat and they had some pleasant table conversation your husband has gained quite a bit of weight due to your cooking talents i remember he used to be a little pipsqueak jules one of the villagers said yes he sure was he is finally coming into his own i guess its probably the french cuisine brigitte agreed no i just reincarnated her husband kidded who wants more to drink brigitte asked getting up to get an extra bowl of baked eggplant do you have any grape juice the ladies from the north asked oh yes we made it ourselves and she went to the kitchen larson makes the clearest wine in the whole region jules informed the company there is nothing artificial in his wine thanks for the compliment jules its true our wine is pure and natural henrik admitted brigitte arrived back at the table with the juice and poured some for the girls careful dont drink too much henrik warned you girls have been eating quite a few grapes i noticed they have a laxative effect you know suddenly fred started to scream he was all by himself in the playpen and no one was paying any attention to him what variety of grapes do you use one of the men asked henrik had just put some food in his mouth and started to choke pinot noir and chardonnay he said coughing and jules who was sitting beside him pounded him on the back a little while later ripening of the wine became the topic of conversation and henrik told them about the ageold wine cellar which was situated underneath the entire house and which could be reached from the living room after lunch ill show it to you some of the original barrels are still down there he said passionately but after lunch everyone wanted to go straight into the garden to relax for a while so his invitation was passed up they all sat in the shade of a large apple tree and ate some chocolate after everyone had rested enough they went back to work many sunny hours and emptied buckets later the day was done and the workers took a refreshing shower at the farm after they got paid they all went home happy that evening brigitte had opened all the windows there was not a breath of wind anywhere its so calm and muggy her husband said it seems like the proverbial calm before the storm tired but happy he sat down beside his wife in the living room the children were playing with lego they are such wonderful little treasures father thought as he watched them affectionately i love them so much and for a moment he held them in his heart he felt overcome with happiness at the same time the coat of arms from the sixteenth century next to the front door suddenly began to move back and forth and the ominous squeaking pulled him out of his reverie a deeply hidden insight welled up in him and his hair stood on end my god i have pronounced something terrible he suddenly realized i was worshiping my children as if they were gods suddenly a strange wind was blowing through the house it was the devils breath close all the shutters henrik stressed that wind is scary brigitte said startled and she quickly walked to the windows within one minute the wind had grown into a fullfledged storm while his wife was closing the windows downstairs henrik flew to the open windows on the second floor the wind was howling through the bedrooms and the curtains were swinging in the air he hurriedly closed the shutters back downstairs again he helped his wife with the sliding doors of the storage space behind the house a true hurricane was traveling through the region and outside the atmosphere seemed haunted the attic door is still open brigitte suddenly remembered and her husband sprinted back up the stairs then they crawled away together in the living room while all the windows were rattling hard something or someone wants to kill our children henrik said suddenly what what do you mean his wife stammered david heard his father speak and looked at him intently with his bright blue eyes its only going to get worse henrik predicted take the children to the cellar and nail all the doors and windows shut there is not much time i have to go now please tell me whats going on brigitte asked urgently dont ask me why he answered i cant explain it i am being led by something higher and he hurried to the front door and looked at his wife and children one last time we may never see each other again he thought heartbroken then he closed the door behind him in the dark larson fought his way through the storm into the hills and he repeatedly had to grab hold of shrubs and trees his grapevines were being pulled out of the ground and sailing past him when he got to the top of the hill he saw how the river had changed into a virulent water mass and was spreading out eerily all over the land for a moment he hesitated but then he decided to run away from home as far as possible maybe to distract the evil from his family as he ran through the hills dark clouds seemed to be following him after a few miles he stopped to catch his breath behind a sturdy tree and started to worry about his wife and kids at exactly the same time a malignant whirlwind tore the roof off their farm and the contents of the entire household flew up into the air pots and pans clothing books tables an ironing board beds everything flew up like it was weightless even the shutters that had been nailed shut got no mercy and in the living room the chairs were dancing across the floor the antique mirrored cupboard exploded and thousands of glass slivers showered down in the interior a short distance away henrik was standing still wondering what to do and not aware of the disaster i cant let myself be controlled by fear he reprimanded himself and forced himself to run again a violent wind soon pushed him over and he hurt himself on branches and rocks he managed to get up but was smashed to the ground again right away in the face of death he had to think of what was dear to him i wonder if my family is still alive he thought when suddenly a cross of insight burned on his forehead evil destroys that which you think of a voice from inside said henrik was terrified by these findings and he quickly tried to change his thoughts dont think dont think he said to himself the evil weather god noticed his resistance and immediately flared up henrik was lifted up and savagely smashed against a tree trunk his ribcage creaked dangerously and he screamed in agony with the greatest difficulty he controlled his thought images which were nothing more than an escape from reality i will have to face a confrontation with that devil there is nothing else left to do it was his last straw and truthfulness was his weapon and he used that weapon to break this thoughts about anyone or anything all hell broke out intensely in response henrik tried to grab hold of another branch but was blown away like a little feather finally he just let himself be taken as an unresisting victim but he kept his faith in tact he even obligingly let himself be flogged which only made the devilish catastrophe worse his surrender to all that is slowly caused a turn and mollified he became aware of a figure the vague form appeared high above him and made a terrific noise then the clouds in the sky started to move in circles around it and they subdued the delirious devil who slowly but surely began to fade after a last convulsion the evil thing gave up and dissolved into thin air the tornado then focused on the knockedout wine farmer who could do nothing but surrender the whirlwind turned out to be benevolent and its power filled him from head to toe when the last of it had been sucked through his body the storm abated and nature calmed down henrik sat up speechless and licked his wounds then he saw a dying phantom the ghost was wearing a robe that hung down to his feet and around his chest he wore a golden band his long beard was as white as snow and his eyes burned like fire in his left hand he held a staff with seven stars and his face shone like the midday sun amazed henrik got up and looked at the wonder the ghost held out a hand in friendship and said i am michaelis nostradamus and ive had to wait in purgatory for centuries for an immaculate and pure person who would be able to free me the seventh valley has been completed and my soul can now finally rest you were the last key and as a token of my gratitude my light will always continue to shine in you his voice sounded like a mighty waterfall my prophesies are destroyed as of this moment he continued the genie is back in the bottle i also only play my role i was dead but now i will live forever for eternity the apparition began to fade your family is still alive theyre fine but i have to go now to say goodbye to my human heart very touched henrik raised his arms and opening them wide answered the earth will always remember you michel nostradamus nodded in agreement took one last breath in the still air and in closing said time is nothing longing for love is everything and slowly his soul disappeared into the clouds the sky cleared up and the wine farmer watched in the heavens a new star could be seennot too long ago when i watched a girl purposely get as drunk as this pretty one did i wouldve moved in for the kill i would have taken her home taken her to bed and not felt guilty at all about knowing that she was making choices without all her cylinders firing i used to never let an easy opportunity pass me by and i never felt bad that my actions werent exactly going to win me any awards for morality i used to like it when things were handed to me with no effort on my part and i liked it that when i walked away i could always brush off any kind of responsibility for wrongdoing and put it on someone else accountability was a foreign thing and back in the day i avoided it like i owed it money but times had changed and somewhere between dying on a hospital bed and coming back to life and seeing the last chance i had at any kind of normality flicker in and out of my little sisters eyes the barest hint of a conscience had woken up inside of me now when i watched this very pretty drunk girl obviously out of control obviously looking for trouble i wanted her to know how heavy an anchor regret could be i still wanted to take her home and take her to bed only i understood the connotation was different now that sliver of conscience was poking at me to do something i had never done and pretend that i was chivalrous and save her from herself no one would ever call me altruistic or considerate but if i didnt step in the beautiful redhead was going to get herself into a whole world of hurt i knew from firsthand experience that some hurt and some mistakes could weigh you down forever carrying the load was exhausting and she deserved better than that even if at the moment she seemed to have forgotten it i wiped my hands on the bar towel that was hanging loosely from my belt in the back and lifted an eyebrow at my cocktail waitress dixie who was watching the same show on the dance floor that i was with wide eyes it was a saturday night so the bar was pretty full and there was a live band playing on the tiny stage but pretty much every pair of eyes in the place was trained on the way the redhead was moving across the dance floor i knew i should have cut her off she was a lightweight as it was but her big chocolatecolored eyes were so sad so tormented i had a hard time telling her no now that i could actually feel shit like empathy and compassion i knew that i had overserved her which led up to the virtual striptease that was now happening in the middle of the dance floor you think all those guys trying to grind on her would flip out if they knew shes more than likely armed dixies voice was laced with dry humor as she took the jack and coke i mixed for her order from me when a girl is clearly intoxicated looking for a good time and just happens to look like her a bullet isnt very much of a deterrent im gonna go pull her out of there after you drop that off will you watch the bar for a second she lifted her own eyebrows back at me with a grin are you sure you want to do that thats like a pack of jackals circling a fallen gazelle it might get ugly if you go and ruin all the fun the band that was the live entertainment for the night switched to a cover of tom pettys you got lucky and the girl in the center of the storm suddenly turned and locked her eyes on mine somewhere in the middle of all her bumping and grinding she had lost her shirt so all she had on was a skintight tank top that wasnt doing much to cover her up her rich auburn hair had fallen out of its ponytail and was sticking to the sweat on her chest and neck while her eye makeup was smeared under her dark eyes her chest was rising and falling from exertion as all her flawless exposed skin gleamed with a sheen of perspiration she looked like something out every wet dream any guy had ever had or a reallife victorias secret model using this noname bar to strut her stuff instead of a catwalk she was going to cause a riot and i think somewhere under all the kamikazes fueling her blood at the moment she knew it i could see it as she stared defiantly at me across the space that separated us im okay with ugly im not okay with her being in the middle of the carnage i shouldnt care shouldnt be concerned the redhead was more than capable of taking care of herself and like dixie had mentioned she was probably packing but i couldnt stop the surge of protectiveness that floated to the surface when a clumsy frat guy put his hands on her tiny waist and drew her back to his chest she didnt struggle at first her senses and reflexes obviously dampened by the steady stream of alcohol she had been swimming in all night dixie left to deliver the drink and came back around the bar with a sigh i cant wait until rome hires his friend to hang around and do security stuff on the weekends i love this place i love my job but watching you guys have to tangle with drunken hotheads all the time is getting old i shrugged and moved past her so that i could go put a stop to the impending disaster the redhead had finally gotten her sluggish wits in gear and was now actively struggling in the frat boys hold its just part of the job though i had to admit that when the boss rome archer mentioned he had an old platoon buddy that was getting ready to come back home and was gonna need something to do until he got his feet under him i was relieved that my time banging heads together when the crowd got rowdy on the weekends was going to come to an end i had a criminal record a long colorful criminal record and anytime i put my hands on another human being in any kind of violent way i automatically saw pages and pages getting tacked onto it like so much from my life before i had died on that hospital table it was something from my past that would always define me and hold me down dixie called to me over the bar as i started to weave my way through the crowd youre too pretty to put that face in front of a flying fist asa be careful frat boy was holding his face while blood rushed out between his fingers as he covered his nose the redhead was being held by two other guys one with each wrist locked down as she glared at the group of men surrounding her she was tall and in ridiculously good shape but none of these inebriated guys would have any clue as to why all they saw was a feisty girl that was wasted and had been enticing them all night long whether it had been intentional or not and of course now that she had made one of them bleed had unmanned him in front of an entire barful of spectators it was clearly about to get nasty it was one thing to get your ass handed to you by a girl it was an entirely different thing to get your ass handed to you by a girl that looked like she should be walking a runway wearing fuckme stilettos it also didnt help save face for the guy that she had on bright yellow pants that hugged her curves just right and breasts that it should be illegal to ever cover up in half of a heartbeat she was in the middle of a tugofwar between the two guys holding her arms and i could see the anger building in the watery eyes of the guy whose nose she had probably broken i gave him a warning look dixie was right i was pretty too pretty to be as ugly as i was on the inside but to counteract the deceptive beauty of my face i was also big and had been in trouble since the day i took my first breath so i generally had a way of letting an opponent know they were going to be on the losing end of a confrontation with me the bleeder took a step back as i manhandled the guy closest to me off of the redheads arm he grunted and swore at me mostly because as soon as she was free and had enough leverage she rammed her knee right into the guys unprotected balls doubling him over i shook my head at her as she turned and sloppily swung at the remaining guy clutching her wrist royal knock it off she ignored me as the band picked up a quick tempo cover of shooter jenningss a hard lesson to learn and went into fullon attack mode now i fully believed there was nothing wrong with a woman defending herself against unwanted advances and it was obvious she didnt want this guys hands on her anymore but this particular girl this surprising young woman that just happened to look like a supermodel was actually a member of the denver police force and i knew she could cause serious damage even in her less than sober state i couldnt allow that not just because the bar would be liable but also because i didnt want her to do something that could ultimately end up costing her her job i reached around royal and got my hand on the fingers locked on her wrist as she wiggled and swung wildly at her captor prying his fingers free was a task made even more difficult by the fact i kept having to duck to avoid an elbow in the face or the back of her fist on the backswing she was quick and strong something that the guy holding her finally realized as she landed a solid punch to one of his temples he suddenly let go and stumbled back as i trapped her flailing arms to her sides and pulled her back to my chest i bent just a little so i could whisper in her ear calm down red we both stared at the guy that had grabbed her and i tried not to notice the way her really spectacular rack was rising and falling right above the arm i had locked across her rib cage even when i tried to help out all those old instincts burned bright and hot right under the surface i wanted to touch her in an entirely unhelpful way she assaulted me he sounded like a disgruntled toddler that had lost his favorite toy to a bigger kid on the playground i nodded and made sure the hills of kentucky were thick in my voice when i told him she sure did but not until you put your hands on her goodolboy charm worked wonders to calm down a volatile situation i think it made people think i didnt have enough smarts to be any kind of real threat despite my size the band was still playing but i dont think anyone was paying attention everyone was watching the chaos royal had created unfold she punched bobby in the face and all he was trying to do was dance with her she broke his nose again i nodded and tried not to think about the way that royals absolutely perfect backside lined up just right with my fly she turned her head just enough that i could see a hint of awareness and panic working through her dark gaze her tongue darted out to slick across her bottom lip and i had to remind myself i wasnt a guy that took advantage of drunk girls anymore at least i didnt want to be that guy but i never really figured i had much of a choice in the matter bobby needs to learn to ask if he wants a girl to dance with him look everybody can just go to their separate corners we can all forget this happened i was cut off as he pointed at me and then narrowed his eyes at royal im gonna call the cops i felt royal start to shake in my grasp that was exactly the outcome i was trying to avoid i lifted an eyebrow shifted my hold on her so that she was behind me and crossed my arms over my chest i figured i looked a lot more intimidating not covered by a toosexyforherowngood redhead you can do that but its gonna shut the party down the band is gonna have to stop all these other folks in here are going to have to stop drinking and its gonna make them mad since they had to pay a cover to get in and hear the music plus im gonna have to call the bar owner and let him know whats going down and thats like waking godzilla up from a nap i rubbed my thumb along the side of my mouth and gave him my best country boy smile it had disarmed more than one person who was out for blood usually mine but i didnt mind using it to prevent any of royals from spilling plus between you and me she has friends on the force the other guy was trying to vet if i was serious or not so i inclined my chin her best friend is a cop if you call the dpd chances are theyre going to send him in since he knows this is where she likes to hang out and then shes going to tell him you and your buddies put your hands all over her without her permission and the cameras will back that up i pointed to one of the surveillance cameras rome had installed all over the place you think thats going to end well for you he looked like he was considering how to answer when the lead singer of the band suddenly called out over the mic so that the entire bar had no choice but to listen you guys suck take your bleeding friend out of here and let everyone go back to having a good time that rallied the rest of the bargoers and suddenly a chant of you suck went up and the grabbyhands bunch really had no choice but to leave there was no way left for them to save face and they didnt want to risk the chance that royal did in fact know a cop they slunk toward the front door as i hauled royal toward the bar and plopped her fine ass in a seat right in the middle where i could keep an eye on her i caged her in between my arms and leaned in close so that our noses were almost touching through clenched teeth i told her sit now i can either call saint to come get you or you can sit here drink water and eat something greasy and terrible until you sober up enough to get yourself home those are your only two options red she blinked criminally long lashes at me and i could swear she looked like she was going to cry i saw her gulp and she gave her head a little nod of agreement when she spoke it was only a hint of sound dont call saint ill wait it out saint was her closest girl friend and also my friend nashs lady she was a sweet and shy young woman that somehow managed to balance out all of royal hastingss bold and brash attitude they were an odd pair but i knew saint would drop whatever she was doing in a heartbeat to make sure royal was taken care of i didnt blame royal for not wanting her friend to have to come collect her in her current state she was a mess she was still beautiful kind of wild and untamed looking but under it all she was a disaster courting trouble as well as danger and other bad things which is what she had been actively doing for the last two weeks this wasnt the first disaster i had been forced to avert because of her antics and the time had come to tell her it had to stop i pushed off the bar walked around the open end and glowered at dixie as she smacked my ass on her way back to the floor my hero i grunted at her in response i was not hero material i fell more along the lines of archnemesis or supervillain i poured royal a glass of water in one of the giant beer steins i had behind the bar and thumped it down in front of her without a word she jumped a little and i could see the regret and remorse starting to work its way into her face a pink flush was blooming over the exposed crests of her cleavage and filling her cheeks i made my way across the entire length of the bar stopping to refill a couple of drinks closing a tab clearing some empty plates until i got to the kitchen entrance that took up the entire back part of the bar we typically only served food until midnight but i knew avett walker the new girl rome had agreed to hire to work in the kitchen as a favor to an old friend was still lurking somewhere around i hadnt seen her hotpink hair dart out of the front door as soon as her shift ended like it normally did she was a mouthy little thing that had nothing but poison and attitude running in her veins as far as i could tell she clearly didnt want to be working here her mom darcy was the kitchen manager and her father was the guy that had sold rome the bar originally but avett didnt seem to have any kind of fondness for the place in fact she didnt seem to have any kind of fondness for anything at all she acted like coming to work each day was a prison sentence which by default made me her jailer since i was her boss we didnt exactly get along i think i saw too much of my old careless and thoughtless ways reflected back at me when i interacted with her i called avetts name and when i didnt get an answer i prowled through the empty kitchen until i got to the massive walkin fridge i didnt have time to screw around so i found some cheese some bread and some random pieces of fruit and figured that would have to do i needed to shove something into royal that would soak the booze up so i could tell her to get her head out of her ass and have the command stick i was kicking the door closed with the heel of my boot since my hands were full when the door to the beer cooler suddenly popped open and avett came strolling out fiddling with the zipper on her obviously stuffedfull messenger bag she stopped dead in her tracks when she saw me her eyes widening and then narrowing in defiance what are you doing back here the kitchen is closed like she had any right to question where i went in this place it was a diversionary tactic i knew all too well i just stared at her and didnt say anything i looked pointedly at her bag and then back up to her chilly hazel gaze whats in the bag she shifted her weight and there was no mistaking the sound of bottles clanking together she was trying to smuggle beer out of the cooler it figured my night needed one more complicated female i had to straighten out to make it more of a headache nothing she went to move past me and the sound of bottles clanging together got even louder my hands were full so i just moved my entire body into her path to stop her avett took after darcy way more than brite her dad brite was a giant of a man with a beard that i was sure had folk songs written in its honor avett was petite and barely came up to the center of my chest and she had to tilt her head back in order to keep glaring up at me what she lacked in height she sure as hell made up for in bad attitude put it back dont do it again and this is the last youll hear about it when i was irritated the south tended to be heavy and thick in my voice and not in the same way it was when i used my drawl to get something i wanted or to make someone think i was nicer and stupider than i really was get out of my way asa no you dont get to steal from rome i dont care what your beef with brite is and i dont care that you obviously would rather be out wrestling wild mountain lions than working here im not letting you take advantage of rome hes a good guy and he deserves better than that we had a glareoff and for a second i thought she was going to try and step around me knowing my hands were occupied but i think there was some kind of invisible thread some kind of aura that we shared that made her instinctively know that she could get away but not for very long she huffed out a breath that sent her pink bangs dancing across her forehead she would be a really cute girl if she wasnt such a pain in the ass and practically a decade younger than me she was just a kid really and she sure as shit acted like it im going to a party and i dont have any money for beer i didnt think it would be a big deal to take a twelvepack from the cooler after all my dad practically handed this bar over to the soldier for free a few beers seems like a fair trade i rolled my eyes it wouldnt be a big deal you know that rome wouldnt care if you asked him but walking around like youre owed something for some unknown reason isnt all right with me and im not going to let you do it i furrowed my eyebrows at her and shifted my weight how can you be broke you just got paid on friday since she worked in the kitchen i knew rome paid her an hourly wage it wasnt enough to retire on but it was enough that it shouldnt be gone in less than twentyfour hours unless she was up to no good instead of answering me she whirled around and went to put the beers back in the cooler i waited until she came back out and made her lead the way out of the kitchen back to the bar i had been gone long enough that the band was done with their set and that meant a crowd had gathered and dixie was standing behind the bar trying to catch orders up i nudged avett with my elbow and deposited my haul into her hands i pointed to royal who was sitting stoic in the middle of the rush her head bent down and her gaze locked on the bar top feed the redhead make sure she eats it and if i ever catch you trying to steal again youre out of here i dont care what i promised brite or how much it would break darcys heart she gave me a baleful look and muttered just loud enough that i could hear it funny coming from you she wasnt wrong it was ridiculous coming from me so i ignored her and dove into the mess of trying to sort the rush out it was only half an hour until last call so it proved to be a little trickier than usual the weekends at the bar were getting busy enough since romes remodel that i thought maybe i was going to have to ask him about hiring another server as well as a bouncer business was good and in order to keep it that way we needed to make sure the crowds got service just as good as the battered old veterans that littered the place during the daytime hours i tried to keep an eye on royal i was worried she was going to try and leave before i could talk to her and before i could judge if she was sober enough to drive but she was in the same spot head bent down eyes focused on the bar and her water was gone she had also put a goodsized dent in the food in front of her so that made me breathe a little easier she was abnormally quiet and i wished i had thought to grab her shirt for her when i pulled her out of the crowd earlier she looked rumpled like she had just climbed out of bed and that wasnt doing a thing to help me remember why i needed to get her out of the tailspin she had been in ever since the week before christmas i got last call done i paid the band and thanked the lead singer for helping me out with the frat kids and he in turn asked me if i thought royal would be interested in going on the road with them as a backup dancer i had to laugh and broke the news to him that she already had a fulltime job i didnt bother explaining what it was because i doubted he would believe me anyway i helped dixie clear the floor and when we started to move people toward the front doors i stopped next to royals side and told her hang out for a minute she didnt respond but she pushed some of her hair out her face tucked it behind her ear and looked at me out of the corner of her eye i took that as silent assent and helped dixie get everyone outside and gave her a hand putting all the chairs up so that the cleaning crew rome hired could spitshine the place before we opened again tomorrow dixie and i had a system since we did this together six nights a week so it was work that went by pretty quickly when i was done i went behind the bar poured myself a dalwhinnie on the rocks and took myself and my drink back around the other side of the bar so i could sit on a stool next to royal everyone teased me that i should drink bourbon or whiskey being as i was from kentucky but i preferred the smooth and dirty taste of scotch it sort of fit since i was both those things myself i took a swig of the drink and set it down with a thunk on the bar i ran my hand through my dirtyblond hair and looked at royal out of the corner of my eye so this is what you do now get drunk rile up the natives take half your clothes off in public and just generally act the fool cause i gotta tell you after two weekends in a row of it i think its probably time you find another bar to haunt i saw her shoulders slump and she matched my sideeye look why didnt you tell those guys i was a cop i sighed and turned to face her i really wished she wasnt such a looker it made trying to be levelheaded and rational around her that much harder because even though you can carry concealed legally because of your badge you still cant be drinking while carrying a loaded weapon thats illegal and a headache you really dont need all of a sudden youre concerned with others being lawabiding a little bit of her sass was coming back and that was a nice change from her maudlin moping that had settled around her since i pulled her off the dance floor no i dont give a flying fuck about others being lawabiding but youve got a job you like friends that care about you and youre way too young to be flushing it all down the toilet even if that seems to be your new mission in life you need to get your shit together royal before youre too far gone to fix the mess you seem so eager to make she was barely twentythree that seemed a lifetime younger than me even though i had a couple more years ahead of me before i hit the big threeoh thats funny coming from you second time i had heard that in less than an hour maybe i just needed to keep my nose out of it and let everyone learn their own hard lessons just like i had been forced to do i picked up my drink and took another slug get it together or dont but this is the final warning about bringing that nonsense into my bar you want to go down in flames i guess thats your call but im not going to watch you burn something flashed across her eyes something so sad and lost it really made me want to reach out and comfort her but touching royal was like touching a live wire and i already had a hard enough time keeping my mind out of my pants and my hands to myself when i was around her she blinked those longass lashes at me stuck her tongue out to flick it across her bottom lip and i forgot how to breathe for a second she did it on purpose i had no doubt one of these days youll come home with me when i ask asa she leaned over on the bar stool a little and put her hand on my thigh my fingers tightened around the tumbler in my hand so hard i was shocked the glass didnt break is that why youre here is that what the show is all about you really want to make that kind of mistake my drawl was thick enough that the words were languid and heavy sounding i felt blood start to race under my skin and i had no doubt that my eyes were probably glowing bright gold in my face it wasnt often someone made me uneasy threw me off my game but royal had done it more than once in our short acquaintance she pressed her weight forward and stopped when her mouth was just a fraction away from mine i could almost taste her in fact if i stuck out just the tip of my tongue i would be tasting her i clenched my teeth to stop that from happening even though i was pretty sure she would taste like candy and fire it seems like all i make anymore are mistakes at least making that kind of one with you would be fun she used her leverage on my leg to push herself upright as she slithered off the bar stool in one seamlessly sexy move it made me bite back a groan if you dont want me here i wont come back she tossed her heavy hair over her shoulder and gave me a steady look out of her dark brown eyes i really thought you would make this easier i didnt say anything as she walked away steady on those killer shoes and missing her shirt even though it was winter in colorado she was obviously sober enough to drive but i had no idea where her head was at otherwise dixie locked the door behind the redhead and wandered over to the bar she grabbed herself a bottle of bud light which of course was sacrilegious in this coors lightdominated bar and refilled my scotch i dont know how youve managed to turn her down more than once she shook her own strawberryblond curls and grinned at me im not even into chicks and i think i would do her if she asked shes pretty amazing i muttered a few swearwords under my breath and tossed the second round back in one swallow it burned a little and i had to blink shes a cop a cop that has arrested me i have better selfpreservation instincts than that in my experience cops were not my biggest fans and i really couldnt blame them i set the empty glass down on the bar and climbed to my feet it was late and i needed a hundred cold showers besides she doesnt actually wanna fuck she just thinks she does dixie snorted thats not what it looks like to me it might look pretty cutanddried from the outside royal was pretty i was pretty and we definitely had a spark but i hadnt lasted as long as i had screwing over everyone whose path i crossed without learning how to look deeper how to see the danger looming and it was obvious to me that royal was dangerous in more ways than one thats a very pretty girl with a very ugly hurt and somehow she got it in her head that she deserves to be punished to hurt even more so shes trying to drag you to bed to punish her that sounds kinky and fun i tossed my bar towel at her and pushed up from the bar so i could do the nightly cashout and go home now the idea of royal in her handcuffs and nothing else was going to be running around in my head for the rest of the night like she needed any help being unforgettable she feels bad and shes doing everything in her power to make herself feel worse i didnt know all the details of what had started royals recent decline but i did know her partner on the force who really was her best friend and had been for most of her life had been injured pretty badly in the line of duty and that royal was currently on administrative leave while the department investigated the circumstances that had led to two cops being shot one of the officers hadnt made it and the other was still in the hospital the other being dominic royals partner im not looking to be any part of that i had used enough people in my life even those that loved me unconditionally to know what being a means to an end for someone else looked like i wasnt going to help royal selfdestruct dixie gave me a soft little grin that reminded me that even though she was tough as nails when she needed to be she was really a romantic sweetheart at her center maybe you should give it a shot and you could make her feel better and maybe she could make you finally see that you have changed over the last year or so i just gave my head a shake and told her flatly thats not what i do nope i destroyed things not repaired them i never lied about the man i had been for most of my life or the things i had done there were so many kinds of really ugly twisted and dark things i was capable of and yet everyone that knew me now seemed to be under the impression that i had undergone some kind of transformation after coming out of the coma i had been in after i died and came back the truth of the matter was i was never going to be a good guy i was never going to be the type of man that made things better regardless of what anyone wanted to believe or how desperately it seemed royal needed someone to wade in and pull her out of the mire i wasnt made to be a hero or a savior i was already so far under the thumb of the specters of my past mistakes there was no way i could pull anyone else to safety the old saying was true a leopard never changed its spots and just like the lurking jungle cat i was a predator through and through even if others wanted to think i had somehow become a house cat chapter 2 royal when my phone which i had left lying right next to my head the night before went off the next afternoon shrieking britney spearss toxic i almost rolled out of bed onto the floor in my haste to turn it off i felt terrible partly because i was hardly sleeping anymore so slipping into a restless catnap in the middle of the day was all that was sustaining me but mostly because the number on the phone was the one i had been waiting for week after agonizing week to show up i silenced the bubblegumpop song with a swipe of my finger across the screen and tried to sound more alert than i actually was when i gasped out a shaky greeting i didnt care what anyone thought of my awful taste in music i slummed in the gutter all day long i tangled with junkies and wife beaters and parents that neglected their kids every single day i refused to listen to anything that wasnt upbeat and full of infectious pop my job wasnt always fun so i tried really hard to make sure the rest of the things in my life were you do know im busting out of here today right i shoved a tangled hank of dark red hair out of my face and scrambled up to the edge of my bed i chomped down on my bottom lip and tried to regulate my breathing of course i knew he was getting out of the hospital today what i hadnt known was if he was going to want me anywhere around him when he finally got the green light to go home i squeezed my eyes shut and was so grateful that we werent facetoface dominic voss knew me better than any living soul on this planet and if we were in the same room he would be able to feel the guilt and selfloathing i had been drowning in lately hell if my current state of distress was apparent to someone as disconnected as asa cross there was no way my best friend and partner could miss it dom being dom he would know it all came from what had happened to him on that callout from hell i know i wasnt sure if you wanted me to come or not i know your sisters are coming to stay with you until you get back on your feet and i didnt want to get in the way i sounded pathetic and ridiculous to my own ears dom and i had been inseparable since we were five years old there had never been a time when he didnt want me around there had never been a single moment in our friendship where i was ever in his way and his entire family thought of me as one of their own i think that made what had happened weigh even more heavily on my shoulders i heard dom sigh and then he swore his deep voice sounded strained as he gently scolded me get your cute ass here royal ive let you sulk for two goddamn weeks get over it shit happens and its gonna keep happening because thats what being a cop is about im in a fucking cast from my ankle to my junk i have a broken shoulder and i cant breathe without it feeling like im drinking acid i look and feel like hammered dog shit and my best friend hasnt been around for any of it can you maybe knock it off now i couldnt stop the tears that were starting to leak out of my eyes i used a knuckle to swipe at them as i climbed to my feet his next words stabbed through me like i was sure he intended for them to do i need you here girly we had always needed each other both in our daytoday lives and on the job that was why i felt so bad it was why i couldnt get my head around how badly i had let him down i was supposed to have his back like he had always had mine and instead i had almost gotten him killed im on my way i hung up the phone after he barked at me that it was about time and rushed around my apartment trying to make myself look presentable after a hard night of drinking i never exactly looked great but throw in a sleepless night and yet another rejection from an outrageously sexy southern bartender and i probably could match dom in the lookinglikecrap department i had dark shadows under each eye i was way paler than normal fine red veins threaded through the white in each eye and i had really ugly bruises surrounding each of my wrists which made shame and regret battle the guilt for the top spot in the flood of emotions i was choking on i knew better i really did i wasnt the type to go out and lose control i rarely drank and when i did i always acted responsibly because i had a big picture to think about only lately that big picture had narrowed to tunnel vision and all i could see was dom getting hit by bullet after bullet and falling over the edge of the fire escape on the side of the building when i wasnt seeing that i was seeing the wife of the officer that hadnt survived the shootout collapsing in the hall of the er as another officer told her that her husband hadnt made it if that wasnt enough to eat at my soul the memory of my lieutenant telling me i had to turn in my gun and badge and go on administrative leave while the department conducted an investigation danced around in my head every second of every day in order to shake some of those awful thoughts loose i was determined to do things i never did things that made me feel free so thats why i was hanging out at the bar thats why i was drinking like a fish and really that was why i was unabashedly throwing myself at asa cross i had never had to chase a guy i had never been interested in the kind of guy that oozed charm and trouble the way asa did and i most definitely had never been one to mix business and pleasure i knew asa was bad news barely tiptoeing on the right side of the law and it was a firm rule that i never got involved with anyone that had been in the back of a police cruiser well asa had not only been in the back of my cruiser but he had also been in and out of jail since before he was old enough to drive the guy liked to make up his own rules and he didnt have a very pretty past cops shouldnt be romantically interested in criminals even reformed criminals but i was in fact i was more than interested but every time i made a move on him and he turned me down it made me wonder if he could see the failure that was haunting me i wondered if that was why he kept saying no i mean i knew what i looked like i knew that when we stared at each other there was interest and attraction glinting dark in his bronze eyes and i knew he was the kind of guy that liked a sure thing i was a sure thing i needed something that felt good i was searching desperately for something that would help me forget even if it was for only a second and i wasnt afraid to admit that i wanted him i made it so easy for him to say yes and yet he kept turning the other way i didnt understand it so it only made me feel even more lost and adrift than i already did if he really wanted me to find another bar i would i only went to the dive he worked at because i wanted him to take me home i wanted him to pull me across the bar and kiss away all the hurt and ugliness that was filling me up i knew i was going about it the wrong way knew that a guy like asa had no use for someone that enforced the law and tried to keep the peace plus it was a long shot considering i had been forced by circumstance to arrest him for assault not too long ago asa might think i was pretty and he might be trying to save me from myself since we had mutual friends but i seriously doubted he was ever going to be able to look at me the same way i looked at him after i had snapped cuffs around his wrists and dragged him to the police station i pulled my hair into a messy ponytail shoved my feet into a pair of battered motorcycle boots and hit the front door i was about to slam it closed behind me when i remembered to grab my keys i was forever locking myself out of placesmy car my apartment and even my patrol car on several occasions it was a bad habit that was a pain in the ass for more than just me but i couldnt seem to shake it even after a mishap had almost led to the breakup of my neighbor and his lovely girlfriend i dashed back inside frazzled and frustrated i scooped the keys up off the spot they lived in by the door and rushed back out this time the hallway wasnt empty and the neighbors girlfriend who also happened to be my one and only female friend on the planet was exiting their apartment across the hall saint was a sweetheart softspoken and serene she just had something about her that had instantly called out to me it was like the chaotic pace and often dangerous parts of my daytoday died down and mellowed out when i was around her i had forced her to be my friend even though she had fought me and the friendship at first now she was almost as close to me as dom was and just as concerned about my recent behavior she was dressed in scrubs under her heavy winter coat so obviously she was on her way to work at the hospital where she was an er nurse her coppery hair which was several shades more orange in color than mine was piled on her head in a messy bun and her face was scrubbed clean saint was a doll and could work the whole freshfacedgirlnextdoor thing unfortunately i wasnt lucky enough to be able to rock the lessismore look successfully so the darkness under my eyes told the entire story of my wild night without me uttering a single word doms getting out of the hospital today i told her in a rush she blinked her soft gray eyes at me and the corner of her mouth tilted in a half smile i know ive been checking up on him i sighed of course she had because she was an awesome friend thank you she nodded slightly and we silently headed for the front door of the converted victorian we lived in he asked about you every time i stopped by his room i gulped a little not because she was passing judgment or being mean but because we both knew i should have been by the hospital to see him i squeezed my keys in my hand so hard the metal dug into my skin deep enough that it hurt i just couldnt i stayed until they came out and told us that he was stable after surgery but it was too much i shook my head and shivered as the frigid denver air snaked down the collar of the hoodie i had thrown on the reason dom was in the hospital for so long wasnt the shattered ankle and broken femur but because one of the bullets that had hit him had sliced clean through one of his kidneys he had almost bled to death before making it to the hospital his mom was there watching me without saying a word i could see her wondering how i had let dom get hurt i could see his sisters thinking why dom and not her i knew i was going to have a breakdown and i didnt want to do it where anyone could see she reached out and squeezed my elbow no one blames you for anything royal that is not what dominics family was thinking and you know it dammit when had she started to see me so clearly this is why having friends was hard for me i blame me saint she sighed and let go of my arm thats what i figured but eventually youll have to get over that hows the investigation going that was a topic i wanted to talk about almost as little as i wanted to talk about how dom had ended up in his current broken state its going internal investigations are always complicated when theres an officer death involved and it was complicated because i was actively avoiding all the things i was supposed to be doing to help myself out there had been other officers on the scene there were witnesses from the neighborhood dom had given his statement and so had the partner of the officer that hadnt made it all the stories matched and laid out the facts that i had done nothing wrong that there was no fault on my part and that the kid i had been forced to shoot was going to keep pulling the trigger until everyone in a uniform was out of his way but i didnt feel cleared i felt dirty and unqualified not because i had pulled the trigger but because i had pulled it too late im sure everything will work out for you in the end is the department making you talk to someone thats a pretty intense situation to work through on your own saint was big on processing feelings i think thats why she was so good in the crisis situations she handled every day she powered through all the tragedy and stress while she was at work compartmentalized it all then came home and let it all out so it never had the chance to fill her up and take her over i wasnt that great at letting it all go in fact as of late i was holding on to everything that affected me on the streets in a death grip i guess i thought if i held on to it no one else would have to deal with the yuck of it all im supposed to go tomorrow supposed to being the key if i could find any excuse to skip hearing a shrink tell me i was just suffering from survivors guilt i was going to latch on to it i had screwed up i knew it and i didnt need anyone to lead me to that conclusion but if i wanted back on the job i was going to have to bite the bullet and force myself to go lie on some stiff leather couch and get my head shrunk saint stopped when we got to my 4runner and tilted her head as she regarded me solemnly i stared back at her because i valued her and the honest friendship she offered too much to just dismiss her concern go listen to what the psychologist has to say you dont have to go through whatever this is alone royal she reached out and gave me a onearmed hug which i returned stiffly whatever this was it was clearly not only affecting me at this point when we pulled apart i gave her a lopsided grin and told her i tried to get asa to go home with me again last night she lifted one of her rustcolored eyebrows at me again i wrinkled up my nose and pulled open the door to my old suv he keeps telling me hes not interested maybe he just doesnt like me she gave a delicate snort and moved to zip up her coat as the wind picked up and turned the winter air into something hovering on the edge of unbearable of course he likes you maybe he can just tell that you dont like you very much right now i scowled at her but didnt argue i didnt like myself so much at the moment i lifted up the sleeve of the hoodie on one arm and showed her my wrist which made her gasp in shock i had too much to drink and got myself into something i shouldnt have asa pulled me out of it and then took care of me until i was sober enough to get myself home nash says even with all the stuff from his past asa really is a pretty decent guy saint sounded unsure of the truth in that though i just shrugged and turned on the car it was freezing and the motor took forever to heat up enough to do any good decent is boring if it means i cant even get to first base with him i sounded petulant and frustrated which made her shake her head at me i think youre looking for trouble on purpose her warning fell on deaf ears i was looking for trouble but trouble wouldnt look back so it was a moot point anyway im looking for something and i dont think theres anything wrong with that no theres not but when you have your shield back and youre in uniform again the game changes royal you might want to consider that i didnt want to think that far ahead i didnt want to think about any of it at all i grumbled under my breath as saint took a step back so i could close the door ill call you monday after i talk to the shrink if i do and ill tell dom you said hello dominic loves you no matter what you know i nodded and for the second time that afternoon i felt tears well up in my eyes thats what makes all of this so much worse ill talk to you later she gave a little wave and headed over to her own little jetta that would heat up and defrost a million times faster than my old tank i could afford something newer and sleeker but the 4runner had been with me since i was a teenager and there were so many good memories tied to it i couldnt stomach the idea of letting it go dom did love me and i loved him he was everything to me he was my guiding light my voice of reason dom was without a doubt my hero and more than that he was the one that always was there to remind me that i had a purpose beyond being a pretty face if it hadnt been for dom there was a good chance i would have bought into my own hype early on when it became clear that the genetic gods had been giving with both hands when it came to my physical attributes dom was always the one that reminded me i was worth so much more than being a piece of arm candy or mindless fluff i was smart i was capable and i wanted to make a difference if i hadnt had dom to believe in me to push me i never would have reached the goals i set for myself if it wasnt for dom reminding me of my worth there was a good chance i could have ended up just like my mother the very thought made me shiver i loved my mom i really did but i had zero patience for her deplorable choices and the way she burned through men like it was a competitive sport my mom had always been more like a best friend than a parent she loved me unconditionally i was her whole world but i wasnt enough to fill up the hole that was left when my father didnt leave his wife to be a family with us my mom never got over the rejection and as a result was constantly chasing down true love and looking for validation from men in all the wrong places my mother was a stunner so i came by my good looks naturally she was also an habitual adulterer and had been through so many marriages and relationships that i stopped counting before i got out of my teens when i was younger i thought it was embarrassing and it made me uncomfortable as i got older i realized she simply wasnt happy had never been happy and as much as she loved me and doted on me i was never going to be enough to fill the void she had in her heart i learned to accept the relationship we had not ask questions and just tried to support her like she had always supported me even if the majority of her decisions when it came to the opposite sex made me squirm in my seat i loved the mom i had every flighty flirty inch of her it was because of dom and not my mother that i excelled i strove for greatness and i had reached every goal i had ever set for myself and now because of me he was laid up full of holes and broken it was absolutely unfair to him and i had no clue how i was supposed to ever make it up to him the hospital parking lot felt like it was a million miles wide as i trudged across it in the cold by the time i hit the sliding doors my fingers were numb and my uncovered ears were burning from the wind i felt like an idiot because i didnt even know what floor dom was on or what room he was in some best friend i turned out to be shame settled heavy and thick on my shoulders and i really had to fight the urge to turn around and go back home and bury my head under the covers the person at the reception desk found doms information for me and i took the elevator up to the correct floor i didnt have to worry about finding his room because both of his sisters were lingering in the hallway as if they were waiting specifically for me all the vosses had beautiful dark hair and eyes in various shades of green ariella was the youngest of the three siblings and she was a firecracker greer the oldest and the most reserved of the group snatched me up in a hug that shocked me into stillness as soon as i reached them weve been so worried about you you havent called or shown your face no one knew what happened to you or how you were handling the investigation i thought ari was going to have to sit on dom to keep him in that hospital bed after the first week when you were a noshow i groaned and hugged her back i couldnt believe how selfish and thoughtless i was behaving i just  i trailed off as ari rolled her eyes at me you were being an asshole greer snapped her sisters name but i squeezed her hand and nodded at ari i was ive never let dom down before and i was having a hard time with it was implied i had moved past it but they didnt need to know that was a big fat lie ari gave me a hard look but inclined her head toward the open door a few steps down the hallway hes been waiting to see you for forever were going run to his apartment and make sure its all ready for him hes gonna be wheelchairbound for the next three or four weeks greer and i are going to alternate weeks with him until hes okay to be on his own i blinked dumbly dom was a big hunk of beefcake he was tall and powerful in amazing shape and had always been the most capable man i had ever known the idea of him in a wheelchair and needing help with daytoday living made the cement block that lived in my guts now get five times heavier i can help just let me know what you need i sounded kind of strangled and strained to my own ears youll be back to work soon ari and i got it besides its payback for all the times he took care of us growing up doms dad had been on the job when they were growing up he was a patrol cop until a confrontation with an armed robber had gone awry and the vosses had suddenly found themselves burying the patriarch of the family well before his time dom had instantly stepped in to fill his old mans shoes like any good son was bound to do the fact that he had taken it as far as going into law enforcement just like his dad was still a sore spot for his mom i cleared my throat and fought the urge to fiddle with my hair nervously dom has always taken care of me too greer sighed grabbed my shoulders and turned me so i was facing the room right he has and we both know what he wants is for you to go back to work hes not going to be able to for lord knows how long so hes going to have to live vicariously through you for a while royal what hes always wanted for you is for you to live up to your full potential dont let this knock you down after how hard youve worked to build yourself up if only it was that easy i inhaled deeply and took the step i had been avoiding for two weeks he was propped up in the bed dark hair mussed all over his head his green eyes were locked on the doorway obviously watching for me his big body was all wrapped up in plaster and bandages his handsome face was dark with irritation and a scruff of beard that was pretty impressive he looked terrible and wonderful all at the same time i was so lucky that he was still alive and i wasnt the one having to tell his family that they had lost another person they loved to the job i couldnt help it the waterworks started up i really wasnt much of a crier but something inside of me was wrong off or not working right the tears leaked out and dom reached out his uninjured arm slowly the small movement obviously hurting him  bolted to the side of the bed and let him tug me softly to his side i felt his lips touch the top of my head and his broad chest rumbled as he told me bout damn time all i could do was whisper back i know i should have been here all along or even more accurately i should have been the one lying in this hospital bed all along how was dom ever going to forgive me if i knew there was never going to be a time when i could forgive myself chapter 3 asa the following weekend came and went without any kind of incident i wasnt sure if that was because royal had taken my warning to heart and stayed home or because romes friend dasheldashchurchill was officially on the payroll there was no way anyone would be stupid enough to tangle with the massive wall of muscle that hardly spoke but glowered like a pro the guys scowl was enough to shut down even the slightest bit of misbehavior and while the break in having to be the bad guy was nice i was worried the guys dark and brooding demeanor could scare off potential customers rome was fairly hulking and on the quiet side as well but there was something about this other exsoldier that indicated loud and clear that at some point in time not too long ago the man had been a stonecold killer and was not to be messed with even dixie who could get along with anyone and everyone was giving the new recruit a wide berth even if she was also giving the brute an interested side eye when she thought he wasnt paying attention all the ladies in the bar seemed to think the caramelskinned behemoth with his mixed ancestry and impenetrable dark gaze was easy on the eyesnot that he seemed to give a rats ass about the female attention it was slow for a monday night so i had sent both of them home early and let avett close down the kitchen there was no sense in paying them to hang around when there was only one person at the bar i knew zeb fuller pretty well he was friends with my brotherinlaw and the rest of the crew i spent most of my time with and he was a regular at the bar he was another beast of a man that emanated a whole lot of dontfuckwithme it must be something about the clean mountain air that allowed the men in the state to grow into giants i wasnt small by any stretch of the imagination but more often than not i found myself eye to eye or having to look up at most of the guys that made up my social circle it was just one more incentive to keep my ass in line there were way too many guys around that were very capable of kicking my ass six ways to sunday if i screwed up again zeb had a pensive look on his face and was absently stroking his beard since moving to denver i had learned quickly that the three bs ruled allbeards beer and babes the milehigh had a plethora of all those things and when in doubt a conversation could always be started by picking one of the holy trinity in a pinch the broncos always worked as a substitute b as well zeb had the beard he didnt drink beer and i knew since he was at the bar spilling his guts all the time that his current babe situation was stuck in neutral because the girl he was hung up on seemed clueless to how he felt about her she was also the older sister of one of his best friends rowdy who wasnt exactly thrilled with zebs interest in his sibling i was finishing wiping down the bar and restocking the cooler while zeb sulked into his almost empty glass of jack and coke i never thought i would be the guy that others went to with their problems i wasnt exactly sympathetic or patient with things that i thought were obvious but ever since i stepped foot behind that bar i felt more like a therapist than a drink slinger what was even more shocking was that i liked it i liked being able to see the situation from the outside and point out things from my own unique perspective after all i had screwed up enough for an entire army of people so i figured i might as well put those hard lessons learned to good use why dont you just ask her out on a date i tossed the bar towel onto the dirtyrag pile and picked up the remote to turn off the tvs i was going to shut it all down at midnight since zeb was the only customer and i knew enough to know he just wanted to talk not to drink he looked up at me and frowned youve met sayer does she strike you as the type to go on a date with a guy like me sayer cole was a bit of a mystery she was a lawyer beautiful in a really elegant and refined way and she had surprised our little group of misfits by coming to denver and claiming one of us as her own blood rowdy never knew he had a sister after growing up in foster care so the reunion had been rocky at best only now she fit in seamlessly with the rest of the wayward souls that made up the tightknit unit my little sister ayden had been so fortunate to marry into i was also lucky that they all took me into the fold based entirely on the fact that ayden wasnt going to give me up she might not like me very much all of the time but she loved me unconditionally and that was enough for the rest of the group to welcome me with open arms shes nice she seems pretty cool with whatever comes her way zeb pushed his empty glass at me and ran his hands through his unruly hair the guy was a contractor built things for a living so it kind of fit that he reminded me of a modernday lumberjack ive been flirting with her teasing her and dropping hints since the day we met shes smart if she was interested she would pick up on what im laying down maybe i braced my arms on the bar and leaned across from him i gave him a steady look and asked seriously but dont you think shes probably a little more used to formal invitations from someone that wants to take her out everything about sayer screams country club and formality maybe she just doesnt get what youre after he blinked at me for a second and then leaned back on his stool you think i shrugged i dont know she hired you to work on her house even after you told her you served time she let you be around salems sister when we all know shes protecting that girl like a mama bear so she obviously trusts you and is comfortable around you maybe shes waiting for you to up your game not all ladies are gonna start pulling off their clothes and crawl between the covers because you smile at them i heard you tell rowdy once that you werent afraid of doing the work if the lady is worth it sayer is worth it she really was she had helped me out of a hard spot not too long ago and when rowdys girlfriend had needed a safe place for her little sister to recover from a really terrible situation sayer hadnt hesitated to take the girl in she was as kind and generous as she was lovely she deserved a guy that was willing to go the extra mile for her even if that guy kinda resembled a tattooed paul bunyan zeb pushed up off the bar and lifted both of his dark eyebrows at me i question taking romantic advice from a guy thats repeatedly turning down the hottest piece of ass ive ever seen thats just wasteful man i rolled my eyes and crossed my arms over my chest thats the whole point shes not a piece of ass and i dont know why shes suddenly acting like she is besides any chick that can throw me in jail when i piss her off is off the table what i really meant but didnt say was that i knew i was bound to screw up and piss her off that was just what i did zeb grunted i think id risk a night in lockup for her saying no to all of that is like a herculean feat someone should nominate you for sainthood i laughed drily and followed him to the front door so i could lock it behind him the halo would burst into flames if they got it anywhere near my head he gave me a hard look you know i dont think youre half as bad as you seem to think you are asa trust me i know better than most about screwing up on an epic level but ive never let that define who i was going to be for the rest of my life i might have bounced in and out of jail since i was a teenager but i had never had to spend more than a few weeks at a time locked down zeb though had served several years behind bars for his mistake the difference between us was that zeb had broken the law because he felt like he didnt have any other choice i broke the law because i wanted to the law got in my way prevented me from getting what i wanted or what i thought i needed so i ignored it and pretended like it didnt matter some people screw up and then some people are screwups i fall firmly into the second category there was no other explanation as to how ayden and i could have half of the same genetic makeup and be so vastly different granted there was a good chance i absolutely took after my scumbag of a father a father we didnt share yet we were so opposite i often had to wonder how we had been brought up in the same house and lived the same hardknock childhood i had no clue how she could be as together as composed and steady as she was i dont know how she had found a space in her new life for me or how she had stayed by my side when i was dying i knew she had every reason to walk away from me but instead she had done everything in her power to save me and she had given me a new life of my own one i was terrified i was going to rip to shreds any second now zeb shook his head a little and yanked the door open i think you need to cut yourself some slack i shrugged maybe i shoved him on his shoulder out the door and closed it in his face i liked zeb we had a lot in common but he didnt know the whole story didnt know some of the really terrible things i had done he didnt know that when i died when everything went black and i knew i wasnt coming back to rejoin the mortal coil every single terrible awful horrible thing i had ever done in my life floated before me live in vivid color the way i used ayden the way i had never stopped her from doing what she was doing which i did so that i could get what i wanted the sex the drugs all of it a kaleidoscope of regret so hard and heavy i was sure it was dragging me to hell i loved my sister more than anything in the world and yet i hadnt ever been able to stop myself from treating her like a pawn in one of my games watching what i did to ayden what i allowed her to do for me was worse than every blow from the baseball bats the bikers had wielded seeing the heartbreak in her whiskeycolored eyes when i finally caught up to her after years apart was enough to make me glad i wouldnt ever be opening my own eyes again on top of that there were the old ladies i scammed and the bikers i ripped off there were the cars i stole and the men i knew my mom was sleeping with to pay our rent while i did nothing to stop it or help the family out there was the debutante i had charmed into giving me her college fund which i promptly wasted on a backroom poker game there was the elderly gentleman looking for a companion that i had convinced not only that i was gay but that i was interested in him convinced him just enough to get him to write me a check so i could pursue my passion for photography needless to say i wasnt gay or a photographer but his ten grand had gone a long way in funding my next scam the number of people i had screwed over was endless and as their faces rolled like a movie behind my eyes as life leached out of me i knew i was getting what i deserved when i had woken up had seen ayden looking down at me while i struggled to realize that even the devil in hell didnt want me i realized something bright sharp and clear i was an asshole i was a bad man that had done bad things and i was always going to be that guy but i never never wanted to hurt my sister again i never wanted her to have to worry about me never wanted her to have to suffer for me or lose anything because of me ever again i was always going to be a screwup but i was going to actively try to avoid causing any more damage and so far it had been going pretty well i just had to hold on to those memories those regrets and that remorse tight enough that my hands would be too full to ever do the devils work again i pulled the cash drawer out and put it and the sales receipts in the safe that was in romes office i made sure all the cameras were on especially the ones in the parking lot that he had recently installed i got jumped one night after work by a bunch of kids with a vendetta that had actually led to my arrest and a legal headache that had taken longer to deal with than it should have because of my past so now i was hypervigilant and always made sure the eye in the sky was watching my every move it was a little after one in the morning the parking lot was mostly empty except for a few cars that were left over from people that hadnt wanted to drive home after drinking or local neighborhood cars that rome let borrow a slot the bar wasnt in a terrible part of town and i was now pretty used to keeping odd hours since i didnt get out of work until well after most of the world went to bed i kind of liked the quiet of it all it was cold out being from the south like me it had taken a couple of winters to get used to the frigid mountain air i didnt love the chill my dislike of winter was enough that i was seriously considering buying a car even though the studio apartment i rented was barely two blocks away from the bar that was another thing that had changed after i came back to life now i could care less about things i used to want the best of it all the nicest clothes the flashiest ride the biggest house and of course the prettiest girl i wanted everything i had never had growing up and i wanted to show it all off and prove my worth now i wanted nothing the less i had the less there was to lose i was rubbing my hands together briskly and blowing into them to try and warm them up when headlights suddenly illuminated me and a vehicle rolled into the parking lot and didnt stop until it almost reached me the lights cut out and the driversside door swung open i wouldve worried tensed up and walked the other way if i didnt recognize the ancient suv and the female driver royal was always going to be prettier than any of the other trophies i used to flash around back in my heyday  prettier even when it was obvious she hadnt been sleeping well i pulled the collar of my shearling coat up around my jaw and stepped around the door to where she was sliding out of her seat to the ground she looked like she had just come from the gym she had on some kind of stretchy skintight pants and a big sweatshirt her hair was tangled in a messy knot on the top of her head and her eyes looked a few shades darker than their normal sweet chocolate color she also had on running shoes instead of her typical sexy footwear and she was shivering in the night air youre out and about late i tried to keep my tone even she was unpredictable and i never knew which way she was going to go with things i was used to being able to read people like an open book but she kept turning the page on me it was always surprising and unexpected she pulled the sleeves of her sweatshirt down over her fingers and looked up at me in a way that made my dick twitch hard behind my zipper it should be legally prohibited for anyone to be that effortlessly sexy i was at the gym because i havent been sleeping well the powers that be cleared me to go back to work at the end of the week as long as i keep seeing the department shrink for the next three months i thought she would sound happier about that fact than she did thats good news  isnt it her shivering turned to outright shaking and i knew it didnt have anything to do with the cold outside against my better judgment i reached out and hooked an arm around her neck and pulled her against my chest i pulled open the sides of my coat and let her burrow into me while she shook uncontrollably i felt her hands snake around my sides and search for warm skin below the edge of my shirt on my lower back i jolted and i wanted to tell myself it was because her hands were like ice but that wasnt it her touch made my skin ripple in excitement ive never worked a shift without dom hes like my other half theyre assigning me a temporary partner to work with until dom comes back she pulled away so she could look up at me through her silky lashes only they didnt say when dom comes back they said if i dont know if i can do what i do without him i felt her fingers dig into the hollow right at the top of my ass and i had to fight down a fullbody shiver you love your job i knew it was true even though she was acting wild and off the tracks lately she was so much of what she did for a living you dont need your partner in order to be a good cop royal we stared at each other silently for a long moment and then the corner of her mouth kicked up in a grin that made my gut tighten and turned my blood thick i needed to let go of her and get to getting before i did something stupid did you miss me this weekend asa that was a loaded question if there ever was one of course i had noticed she wasnt around but i had steadfastly refused to acknowledge how her absence made me feel so i sighed and asked her what are you doing here so late she cocked her head to the side and her eyes narrowed just a fraction her fingers dipped below the waistband at the back of my jeans and i had to suck in a breath through my teeth which hurt because the night air was freezing i dont know every time i cant seem to figure out where im going lately i always end up wherever you are i swore and went to take a step away from her but her hands just dipped lower and tugged me closer you need to get your compass fixed then its pointing you in the wrong direction red suddenly it went from being below zero to feeling like we were standing on the surface of the sun my breathing went shallow and a little erratic as her gaze went all liquid and melty the more you tell me that the more determined i am to prove you wrong then she stood up on her toes so that she could put her mouth on mine and it was all over i knew it was coming we had been dancing around each other for months she was too pretty and too persistent for this not to happen at some point in time she was also too kind and far too good to let someone like me put my hands on her i wasnt really what she wanted but i was getting tired of trying to tell her that despite my best intentions this inferno that raged between us was going to burn out of control and she had just lit the match and tossed it carelessly on the tinder her hands found their way to my sides as her soft lips did their best to render me mindless and stupid with lust i could inhale her it would be so simple to just get lost in all the soft and sweet that made her delectable but somewhere in the back of my mind all the ways in which this was going to go horribly wrong were poking at me i raised my hands and gently cupped her jaw i ran my thumb back and forth across skin that couldnt possibly be that soft and tried my damnedest not to let her lead me to a place i would never find my way back from i pulled away from the exquisite brush of her mouth along mine just as her tongue darted out to trace along the sealed seam of my lips it made me groan out loud i was going to put a stop to it i needed to end it now but she was quick and took advantage of my reaction by slipping her tongue inside my barely parted lips and then it was hopeless to stop the avalanche of desire that engulfed me after all i never claimed to be an angel and even the devil could only play with fire for so long before he gave in to unholy temptation and danced in the flames i backed her into the open doorway of the car i tunneled my fingers into her hair where it was tight against her head and i inserted a leg between hers so that our pelvises were flush against each other i wasnt nice i kissed her like she had been after me to kiss her from the beginning of this game i used my tongue i used my teeth i didnt let her breathe and i didnt give her any kind of space to move away from me as i crowded in on her i reached around her and grabbed her very spectacular ass in one hand in a really classless move and made sure to manhandle it and her in a very obvious way if she wanted me how i really was then she was going to get it i had no problem letting the pretense fall away especially when she was writhing and whimpering against me i twisted my tongue around hers i sucked hard on her lower lip until she gasped i pressed my chest into hers until i could feel the rigid points of her nipples even through all the layers of clothes that separated the two of us i felt her fingernails dig harder into my skin where her hands were still trapped under my shirt i thought maybe she was getting the point that this was bound to be a train wreck and that her common sense was finally waking back up but just as i was about to let her go to pull back and get some muchneeded breathing room so i could get my whirling thoughts back in line one of those dangerous hands suddenly detoured drastically south and the next thing i knew she had her palm wrapped fully around the rockhard erection that was straining the front of my jeans the contact was enough of a shock that i automatically reared back and moved to grab her wrist she just grinned devilishly up at me and fluttered her eyelashes with false innocence were in a parking lot out in the open you really want to go there with me red not to mention this little fiasco was being recorded for all of eternity and it wasnt exactly a show i wanted prying eyes to see i dont think royal was an exhibitionist either but whatever was working in her complicated mind had her acting out in all kinds of hazardous and surprising ways i growled her name when she slid her palm up and down making my dick jump like a welltrained animal at her touch one of her auburn eyebrows shot straight up and she stuck just the tip of her tongue out to taste her stilldamp bottom lip goddamn if every single thing she did didnt make me think of darkened rooms and lots and lots of naked skin why not its the closest youve ever let me get she gave the turgid shaft a hearty squeeze and that made my eyes roll back in my head i was on the verge right on the cusp of picking her up and throwing her into the suv and just giving her what she had been asking for when my phone rang considering it was well past the middle of the night and the ring tone was the specific one assigned to my little sister i had a mild panic attack and pried royal loose from my junk and finally stumbled a few steps away from her ayd i couldnt help the harshness of tone as i barked out her name oh my god asa shaw just went into labor my sister was screaming so i had to hold the phone away from my ear okay  and  shaw was aydens best friend the two of them were beyond tight and i knew it had been really rough for ayden to move to austin so that she could be closer to her husband when her best friend was expecting her first child i calmed down when i realized shaw was okay and there was no crazy emergency you better get your ass to that hospital and be there in my place until i can get to denver jet is booking a flight for us right now but i still wont be there until the morning you need to be there for me asa jet was aydens husband and also a really good friend of the babys dad he would move mountains to make sure ayden didnt miss this major moment in rule and shaws life i rubbed my hands through my hair and blew out a breath that fogged up in front of me shaw isnt going to want me there ayd shell want you i know that but i might not make it in time so youre going to go to the hospital and substitute for me she was screaming and almost hysterical so i knew there would be no reasoning with her you need to keep me updated on everything thats happening while im on my way there you have to do this for me asa rule was romes younger brother the entire archer clan was bound to be on hand not to mention all the other various members of the gang that worked with rule at the tattoo shop he owned with nash the maternityward waiting room was going to be full of the marked family and they really didnt need me in the way but i had promised myself i was never going to let ayden down again so i grumbled my agreement to go and hung up on her before she could keep screaming at me i looked at royal who was texting on her phone and chewing on her lower lip not at all like a mere moment ago she had had her hand in my pants she looked back up at me with a crooked grin saint just texted that shaws in labor i nodded and then frowned when my phone buzzed in my hand with a text i thought it was going to be ayden so i was surprised when the message was from rome instead another archer is on the way get your ass to the hospital it took me a minute to understand that i was actually wanted there for this big event i looked up at royal in confusion rome wants me there of course he does i frowned at her what do you mean of course he does she made a face at me and moved to climb into the drivers seat of the 4runner youre friends and practically business partners rule has nash jet has rowdy and rome has you everyone needs someone to lean on and bringing a new life into the world is most definitely a big deal now come on ill give you a lift down there i was stunned speechless so i just moved around the car and climbed in the passenger side i slumped down once i was situated and stared straight ahead i liked rome i respected the hell out of him he was also on my newly formed list of people i never wanted to disappoint he had given me a shot when everyone else in the world seemed like they were just waiting for me to fuck everything up i owed him a lot but it had never occurred to me that somewhere along the line that had morphed into him relying on me and respecting me as well it was kind of a foreign concept to me and i wasnt sure what to do with it one of these days youre going to let me finish what im always trying to start with you asa royals voice was low and there was a needy thread in it that twisted and twined around my heart that couldnt happen i couldnt let her get to me that would be bad news for both of us it was time to stop pretending and let her see my true colors i leered at her and told her flatly any guy that gets your hands around his dick is gonna finish red it was crude and unnecessary but it made her be quiet for the rest of the ride to the hospital and i spent that time convincing myself it was for the best   wasnt it chapter 4 royal my adrenaline was crashing partly from the lack of sleep and the excessive workout in the gym but mostly from being burned alive from the inside out by asa i knew that once he let me get close enough to touch i wasnt going to be able to stop there was just something about him some kind of lure that pulled at me when i was around him that was too hard to fight against i wasnt exactly shy but i also wasnt the type to just stick my hand in a guys pants and go for the gold either asa pushed me against all of my boundaries made me forget that there were consequences to my actions and i loved every single thing about it i loved that when i was close enough to breathe him in he was all i could feel and i loved the way his glimmering amber eyes seemed to see everything i was trying so hard to hide they were hot enough to melt the hardest metal and i was far from being forged out of steel and iron at the moment i felt like i was made of paper and fluff i had every intention of just dropping him off at the hospital and going home to try and pretend to sleep the ride to the hospital passed in absolute silence and i could see the way the muscles in his chiseled jaw were clenching and unclenching as we got closer i wasnt sure if it had to do with me or with the impending new addition but it was clear he was lost in his own head and i wasnt allowed inside whatever he was musing on it wasnt making him too happy i could tell even in the dark of the car as his eyes shifted from their normally burnished gold color to a much darker and heavier brown i pulled to a stop in front of the massive medical building and waited for him to climb out i wasnt going to say anything figuring i had gotten myself into enough trouble for one night but he cocked his head to the side and turned in his seat a little to look at me questioningly arent you coming in my hands curled around the steering wheel involuntarily and i blinked at him in confusion why would i i was tight with saint and i really liked nash he was pretty much the nicest guy ever but i hardly knew shaw and romes wife cora kind of scared the crap out of me i got along fine with salem her nobullshit attitude was awesome and i liked that she always spoke her mind plus when her sister had been abducted i was the first person she turned to and that created a lasting bond between the two of us but i was pretty sure ayden was going to show up in no time flat and i really didnt want to be around when she did yes she had apologized for losing her shit and being a stonecold bitch to me when she found out i was the one that had arrested asa and i believe she meant it but i had no plans on hanging out and making a happy situation awkward i hadnt seen ayden since the day she bailed asa out of jail and i was in no hurry to have a reunion especially if i couldnt manage to keep the way i felt about her troublesome brother on lockdown i knew instinctively she wouldnt approve why wouldnt you his drawl was so smooth so velvet soft as it wrapped around me i just wanted him to whisper things to me in the dark forever im friends with saint and i adore nash but this is a big deal something you share with family im not part of that he just stared at me and then grunted go park were going up together i shook my head no were not i watched as the fire lit back up in his eyes and they switched back to their intoxicating whiskey color fine he settled back in the seat crossed his arms over his chest and lifted a sandyblond eyebrow at me if you dont have to go up then neither do i you can drop me off back at the bar i gasped at him a little and narrowed my eyes at him rome asked you to come you should be inside right now not arguing with me youre wanted up there his mouth kicked up on the side and i saw just how easy it was for him to charm people out of common sense he was pretty day in and day out but that grin had the devil and temptation in it and it turned him into something otherworldly no mere human looked that good after a full day of work and a bout of unfulfilled groping and fondling it was obvious the path to every decadent sin led right through asa cross and man oh man did i want to race down it i would never understand why he insisted on putting so many roadblocks in my way saint got in touch with you so obviously someone wants you here shes shy and there is a lot of commotion to handle when this group gets excited about something you ever stop and think maybe she needs you as her buffer i cringed because i did know that saint loved nashs friends was deeply immersed in their world and definitely accepted as part of the ramshackle family but it was easy for her to get lost in the sea of strong dominant personalities and she did like having me around to be her port in the storm only instead of wanting to be there for my friend i wanted to run because i didnt know if i could stand any more judgment coming my way i had only been doing my job i hadnt wanted to be the one to put asa in cuffs and take him in but it had to be done and i unfortunately had to be the one to do it i respected all of those ladies so much seeing disappointment in their eyes when they looked at me might very well be the thing that tipped me over the edge of the cliff i was precariously holding on to at the moment i sighed because i could see that asa was serious in his threat calling him every bad name in my head that i could think of i wheeled the 4runner into a parking spot and turned the engine off youre a manipulative jerk you know that he finally threw the door open and climbed out the blast of winter air almost knocked me over and i remembered belatedly that all i had on was my gym clothes he walked around the front of the car and stopped when he reached my door without a word he pulled it open and put a hand on my arm and practically dragged me out he shook his head when he saw how i was shivering and took his big heavy coat off and put it around my shoulders it smelled like him and i wanted to cuddle into it and rub my face in the leather but i was too busy glaring at him as he told me now youre catching on red all he had on was a longsleeved thermal so i tried to hand the coat back to him but he just grunted and put a hand on my lower back and guided me to the front doors i blew out a breath that fogged up the air in front of us and told him quietly your sister hates me shes gonna lose her mind when she shows up and sees me here with everyone he chuckled and the sound sent chills racing all across my skin ayden is protective  of her friends of her man of me she sometimes goes off before she thinks things all the way through she doesnt hate you she hates that ive lived the kind of life that i have in fact the only person shes ever actually hated is me that wasnt the first time shes had to come get me out of jail and lord only knows if itll be the last she knows you were just doing your job royal she just wants to save me shes always wanted to save me i cut him a hard look out of the corner of my eye why didnt you say anything that day those kids jumped you hurt you and yet you just let us take you in with no complaint why i had wondered since the day dom and i had been sent to the bar to pick him up the hospital was busy i was here enough that i knew the way to the labor and delivery unit without having to ask for directions asa followed along beside me without responding to my question i thought he was just going to ignore me until we got in the elevator and the doors swished closed he turned and faced me and that grin that turned his face into something i would dream about forever flashed at me whats the point im always going to be the bad guy even when im not i frowned you could have defended yourself you were innocent those kids set you up there was video proof of the fact which had ultimately led to him being cleared of all the charges that were filed against him i started a little when he reached out and very gently ran the tip of his index finger over the line that had furrowed between my eyebrows as i scowled up at him im not defending myself ever again not to my sister not to the police not to anyone people are going to think what they want and sadly most of those things that they think are going to be right about me im guilty of a lot of bad shit royal most of it i never got caught for karma has a way of catching up with you especially when you laughed in her face one too many times i was baffled by his response and sort of stunned by the care in that simple touch are you telling me you wouldve been willing to go to jail for something you didnt do as some sort of penance for all the other bad stuff you did in the past thats crazy asa he just shrugged a shoulder and the doors swished open and we walked into a waiting room full of anxious and excited family and friends i knew he was carrying around a barrel stuffed full of shame and remorse from his misdeeds of the past what i hadnt realized up until that very moment was that he was willing to let that barrel crush him rather than set it down and sort through its contents saint was at the desk talking to the lady behind it rome was pacing back and forth in front of an older couple that i assumed had to be his and rules parents since shaw had almost no contact with her family salem was curled up in a ball on one of the chairs with her head on rowdys shoulder nash was leaning against the wall with a baseball hat pulled low over his eyes and cora was nowhere to be seen i faltered a little bit when all eyes turned to us as we approached at first i thought they were all wondering why i was there but quickly realized that they were all wondering why asa and i had shown up at the exact same time and that they were all probably curious as to why i was still wrapped up in his coat i shrugged out of it even though it felt like i was handing over a security blanket and cleared my throat hey asa echoed the greeting and shook romes hand as the gigantic retired soldier walked over i squeaked a little when the big man scooped me up in a tight hug that i couldnt help but return when he put me back on my feet i just gaped up at him in surprise he smiled down at me and i couldnt help but smile back i was going to have cora ask you to go get him if he didnt show i was gonna tell you to use force if necessary asa made a noise and lifted an eyebrow at his boss wheres cora this doesnt seem like something she would miss we wandered farther into the waiting room and i let out a sigh of relief when saint made her way over to my side she linked her arm through mine and gave me a knowing look i just shook my head and told her later we can talk about it later she just smiled at me and propped herself up next to nash who tilted his head down at me in greeting rome ran his hands over his head and his massive chest expanded as he huffed out a frustrated breath shes in the bathroom something shifted across his handsome face shes not feeling well at the moment rome and cora had recently gotten engaged and they had a daughter who was just starting to walk which constantly kept them on their toes she was full of her mothers fiery personality and her dads stubbornness which meant keeping up with little rj was a fulltime job they were a rocksolid family unit and it made me have hope for my own future i wanted to believe that something like what rome and cora had could exist without infidelity without jealousy and drama in my life at some point in fact all of these people had relationships i envied and admired they were all determined to make them work no matter what the cost they wanted to be together and they all did whatever it took to make that happen i really wanted someone to feel that way about me nash pushed the brim of his hat up and his periwinklecolored eyes shone at me with unbridled amusement any particular reason you showed up at the exact same time as asa i was pretty sure saint had told him about my current infatuation but i wasnt in the mood to share or be teased so i just shrugged good timing i guess nash was rules best friend so punching him in the gut to get that cocky grin off of his face wouldnt be in good form considering the situation i let go of saints arm and found a seat that was off to the side i kicked my feet up on the one across from me and settled in to wait having babies took a long time and it wasnt like i was going to sleep anyway i was drifting in my own thoughts thinking about asas startling revelations that he was willing to go to jail to pay for past crimes thinking about the way he tasted the way he felt so hot and hard in my hand i was thinking about the idea of going back to work without dom at my back and how that was almost impossible to get my head around i also couldnt get my mind off the fact that all i wanted when i couldnt sleep and the gym wasnt enough was to go toetotoe with the southern bartender i couldnt get out of my head my crush was turning into an obsession i jolted a little when a tiny body landed in the chair next to me cora looked at my sprawledout form and kicked her much shorter legs out in front of her with a grin not even close there was still a foot beyond the toe of her combat boot and the opposite chair i rolled my head to the side so i could look at her as she settled in next to me cora was the unofficial guardian angel of this group she was a petite powerhouse of a woman and when i wasnt sort of terrified of her i really liked and respected her tonight she looked a little pale and she had obvious bags under her two differentcolored eyes hows it going i figured if anyone would know it would be her fine rules actually handling all of it better than rome did rome had the nurses and my obgyn scared to come near me rules taking it all in stride as long as shaw is cool he seems cool but the real contractions havent started yet we might have to send in the reinforcements if he flips out like his brother did i laughed i had no doubt rome was extra scary when he was stressed and freaking out he looked like he could win a war all by himself with no weapons just standing off to the side chatting with asa well thats good its nice youre all here to support them ayden called asa shes on her way already cora tilted her head back on the chair put a hand over her tummy and squeezed her eyes shut she looked a little green all of a sudden and i sat up straighter i was going to ask her if she was okay when she breathed deep and then turned her head to look at me as whatever was wrong with her apparently passed shes going to be devastated if that baby comes before she gets here moving to austin with jet was the best choice but its hard on them with all of us still here she told asa he had to be here just in case she couldnt make it cora nodded and smiled at me he needs to be here regardless and so do you it was uncanny how she always seemed to see everything im here i said it begrudgingly yeah but you had to think about it first you belong here royal dont doubt it but i diddoubt it that is i just didnt know how i fit things just felt off and a little strained after i had to take asa in i wasnt really sure how to handle that and making friends has never been all that easy for me most girls didnt like me or didnt trust me and boys only wanted to pretend to be my friend in the hopes it would lead to more aside from my tight bond with my mom my relationship with dom and his sisters and now saint i had lived a pretty solitary life shit happens what happened with asa wasnt your fault and we all know that she gave me a very pointed look her brown eye hard and her blue eye sharp do you i wanted to tell her everything felt like it was my fault it felt like all i could do anymore was make mistake after mistake i never got the chance though because panic crossed her pretty face and in a heartbeat she was up out of the chair and darting across the waiting room to where the bathrooms were located romes deep voice rumbled with a litany of swearwords as his mom scolded him which he blatantly ignored as he followed his tiny fiancée into the ladies room he ignored the nurse that called out to him as well which had all the guys gathered around laughing i was pondering coras words about fault when her nowvacant seat was filled with a much bigger masculine body whenever i was within touching distance of him all my senses seemed to go into overload he draped one of his long arms across the back of my chair and looked at me out of the corner of his eye you okay his voice was softer than usual and way too close to my ear i gulped a little and nodded it was the fact he asked the fact that i think he really cared whether i was okay or not that overshadowed all the red flags he liked to wave in my face warning me away from him yeah im glad i came up with you its nice to see this see what i waved a hand vaguely around the room indicating where salem and rowdy were cuddled together where nash had wrapped saint up in his arms and was holding her where rome had disappeared after cora and even where the older archers were sitting huddled together happiness togetherness unity it was just me and my mom when i was growing up and she jumped from man to man always looking for something she couldnt seem to find its pretty cool to see couples that actually want to be together stability is kind of a foreign concept to me he kicked his long legs up like mine were and adopted a similar pose i shivered a little when his side pressed along my own he grinned at me when he noticed my reaction you can have all the stability you want when you stop looking for trouble he was probably right although trouble sounded like so much more fun right now and what i wanted and what i needed were absolutely not the same thing i didnt reply instead i tried really hard not to move as i felt the tips of his fingers start to play with the end of my long ponytail where it hung over the back of the chair i dont think he was even aware that he was doing it that is until i glanced at him and noticed the golden glow shining out of his eyes this was not a guy that ever did anything without being very aware of the effect it was having on the people around him he wasnt just trouble he was potent and more dangerous than most of the stuff i saw on the streets every day at some point the monotony of waiting for endless hours long into the night the quiet murmur of voices the squeak of rubber shoes on the linoleum floor all worked together to lull me to sleep one minute i was thinking about how odd my night had turned out about how when i felt my absolute worst there was this remarkable foundation of wonderful people to catch me i wasnt used to having any kind of safety net aside from dom and i had to admit it was really nice to have a soft landing instead of a brutal crash for once in my life but of course like everything in my world lately drifting off into a little catnap couldnt just be easy and rejuvenating as soon as the darkness descended it was there the day everything changed forever i heard the gunshots heard the cops that had been on the scene before us shouting heard the people in the neighborhood chattering next to the dilapidated building that had been converted into a monster meth lab i heard the sirens i heard my radio squawk that there were several officers down it was a bad situation all around but dom and i were trained it was our job to go into bad situations and make them better i heard dom telling me we should go into the alley and i blindly agreed i heard his boots rattle on the metal as he found a fire escape and started to climb up i told him i was right behind him we always had each others back dom barked at me to stay put to cover him from the group we had no idea how many shooters there were had no idea if the building was clear or not but again we were trained and this was our job i had my gun out i was watching staring hard at the space above doms head making sure no one could get the drop on him there were more shots fired i had no idea if they were our guys or the bad guys and i didnt care as long as my partner was okay i heard dom make a noise as he reached the top of the fire escape i could swear i heard every single snowflake that was falling that night as it hit the dirty ground around my booted feet i heard dom call an allclear saw him move to go through a shattered window and then i heard it  nothing more than a whisper a faint sound of a can or some other piece of trash rolling on the asphalt i moved my attention away from dom for a split second half of a heartbeat not even a full blink and then hell was unleashed a kid a boy that was barely out of puberty popped up over the edge of the roof opened fire from his higher position and hit dom he took two shots in the vest one ripped through his arm the force and surprise sent him stumbling backward until he hit the waisthigh railing of the fire escape and started to tumble over it one last bullet had caught him just right in the side but it was the fall that did the most damage then all i could hear was screaming my own and doms as he fell i returned fire caught the kid dead center in his chest it didnt matter i thought dom was dead and i couldnt stop screaming i woke up with a jerk i was covered in a light sheen of sweat and noticeably shaking luckily this time i wasnt making any noise and no one seemed to notice my disheveled state mostly because ayden and jet had arrived and everyone was gathered around saying hello i watched as asa pulled his strikingly beautiful little sister into a warm embrace and then it was like shaw and the baby knew like her and rules baby boy had been waiting for just the right minute to make his grand entrance into the world he seemed to know the exact moment that his whole family was there to meet him because it wasnt until the entire gang was present that reyer remington archer made his debut i had to say it was the best thing that had ever been waiting for me on the end of the nightmarish visions of that horrible night and i would forever be grateful i was allowed to be part of it chapter 5 asa about two weeks after the night at the hospital i walked into the bar full of trepidation rome had called and asked me to come in an hour early because he wanted to talk to me about something i couldnt for the life of me figure out if i had screwed something up or done something wrong but his grave tone was more serious than usual and it made my longhoned selfpreservation instincts kick in if he was going to can me tell me to get lost i told myself it was no big deal i could hit the road i could figure out something else to do but the bar had really sort of become the first place that felt like it was solid under my feet and i didnt want to admit that losing that scared the hell out of me not having this place really would set me adrift and when i was adrift i got into trouble  lots of trouble ayden and jet had stayed for a week my sister wanted to be there when shaw took baby ry home and got settled the nickname was cute and shaw loved it because she was a huge j d salinger fan plus knowing who the kids dad was he was bound to have a little holden caulfield rebellion in him it wasnt enough time with my sister and even though i could see she was happy really happy with her choice to move in order to get more time with her man i missed her and i could see that she was still worrying too much about me i tried to tell her that i was fine i tried to explain that if i was going to fuck up it wouldnt matter if she was here in denver or in austin but that just made her tawny eyes spark at me in anger i loved ayden more than i ever knew i was capable of but i wasnt going to try and fool her into believing that i was never going to screw up again all i could do was try try and be better try and be honest try staying on the right side of the law and not running when things got hard trying was just going to have to be enough for ayden and for me during the day the bar was fairly quiet there was a whole slew of retired veterans that liked to hang out and share old war stories it never ceased to amaze me how many of them had to do with exwives and old lovers rather than any actual war rome typically opened the bar up and hung out until i got there in the early evening to run the night shift he wanted to be home with his family during the evening and i couldnt say i blamed him for that being a retired soldier himself rome had an easy way with the grizzled clientele and preferred to leave the more lively and rambunctious party crowd to me when i walked in the front doors he wasnt around and brite the guy who had sold rome the bar in the first place was standing in my usual spot behind the long wooden bar darcy the bars cook and brites exwife had her head poking out of the kitchen and the two of them appeared to be arguing in low voices i dont think either of them copped to the fact that they might be exes but were still practically married wife number three was long gone and darcy wasnt just his only childs mother but really the love of his life i had asked rome about it once and he just shrugged and told me that good women were complicated and hard to hold on to i didnt understand it until i walked into the liquor storeroom unannounced one day between shifts and found darcy with her legs in the air and brites giant form hovering over her in an unmistakable way there might not be rings but there was love and passion still there too bad their daughter was a gradea pain in the ass brite cut off whatever he was saying to darcy and she ducked back into the kitchen his teeth flashed at me through the miles of beard that covered his face and he crossed his arms over his barrellike chest brite had so much dontfuckwithme pouring off of him it always surprised me how softspoken and insightful he really was he looked like a hells angel not a savior but he was he had saved this bar he had saved rome he had given all those vets a place to feel secure and now he was trying his hardest to save his obviously wayward daughter even though she absolutely didnt seem to appreciate the fact hows it going son his voice rumbled like thunder over the rockies i shrugged off my coat and ran my hands through my hair its going you have any idea why rome called me in early he shook his head and lifted a bushy eyebrow at me how is avett doing tell me the truth asa rome doesnt want me to worry says he can handle her but i raised that girl i know all the kinds of headaches she can be i sighed under my breath her attitude sucks she doesnt listen she fights with darcy she hates it here which is a shame because shes one hell of a good cook she really was when she wasnt just throwing together the bar food the joint specialized in when she made something for herself or was playing around the girl was obviously talented i told darcy once that someone should tell avett to go to culinary school to which darcy had sighed and looked like she was going to cry turned out avett had just flunked out of regular college so any kind of expensive specialty school clearly wasnt in the cards the girl was on a downward spiral i could see it clear as day mostly because it was a ride i was all too familiar with brite swore under his breath and raised a hand to stroke his beard you feel comfortable firing her if she crosses a line i dipped my chin down thinking about the beer in her purse i will do what i have to in order to keep the bar and rome safe he nodded grimly at me thats what i wanted to hear shes driving darce nuts the girl is going to be the death of us both i made a noise of agreement rome in the office brite nodded and again flashed me a grin that had to fight through his facial hair you look nervous son dont be i was annoyed that my typical mask of indifference and carelessness had slipped so i struggled to put it back in place as i walked down the hallway where the restrooms storage and tiny back office were located i knocked on the door before pushing it open and noticed rome was on the phone when i walked in i sat in one of the ratty chairs that was up against the wall while he continued to grunt and reply in oneword sentences to whomever he was talking to there was paperwork on the desk cases of alcohol were piled up on the floor and romes gym bag took up the space on the other available chair his chair squeaked as he leaned back heavily in it said i love you more meaning the person on the end of the call had to be cora and finally hung up and looked at me i wanted to grin at him to play it all off like whatever was about to go down didnt mean shit to me but instead i felt my spine stiffen and my eyes narrow whats up i didnt really know what to do with the fact that this somehow mattered so much to me the only things i had ever cared about before were materialistic and my sister this was so foreign and i hated how uneasy it made me i wanted to squirm but i forced myself to stay still he rubbed his palms into his eyes and pressed down on the scar that bisected his eyebrow coras pregnant i rolled my eyes and crossed my leg so that my ankle was resting on my knee you dont say sarcasm was as thick as kentucky grass in my tone he blinked at me for a second and then blew out a breath what do you mean i snorted i saw her at the hospital i saw you at the hospital if it was the flu or just a cold you wouldnt have been all over her like a mother hen and i doubt cora wouldve looked so happy his blue eyes widened a fraction and then a grin split his stern expression yeah she just hit a little over two months she wasnt as sick with rj but she was a hell of a lot moodier i didnt know you were trying to have another baby his big shoulders rose and fell we werent but we werent not trying either i got a fiancée and a new baby all within a few months of each other and that makes a man start to think about whats next that made me laugh i was genuinely happy for him congratulations we wanted to wait until rule and shaw got to take ry home and had a little while to bask in the newbaby awesomeness before we said anything rule as a daddy is a miracle that needs to be appreciated fully for a while and i dont think my mom can handle any more archer good news without exploding so you and brite are the only ones that know for now got it is that what this little powwow was about if so all my muscles could unclench and the breath i was holding could finally escape my frozen lungs i gritted my teeth when he shook his head in the negative no i need to talk to you about the bar i didnt want to give away the fact i was sort of falling apart on the inside so i just stayed silent and waited for him to keep talking he just stared at me for a minute and then rocked back in the chair and put his hands behind his head brite sold me this bar for a hundred bucks i thought he was crazy i agreed i didnt get it at the time but i do get it now it wasnt about the bar or about giving me something to do it was about taking something beaten something that had adapted and survived and breathing new life into it did you know that even with the expense of adding dixie and avett to the payroll we still turned a profit last year and not just a few bucks an actual decentsized profit we were busier and busier and the crowd was getting more and more diverse the live music helped and so did the fact that romes friends and family were gorgeous and liked to hang out here the bar was hip now so i really wasnt surprised thats good news yes it is and it has a shit ton to do with you asa you work your ass off youre here more hours than is healthy you take care of the staff you take care of the customers no matter who they might be and goddamn youre good behind that bar people fucking love you thats because i spent most of my life tricking people into thinking i was lovable when the opposite was true he dropped his arms and got to his feet and walked around the desk so he could perch on the corner closest to me it was a small space and rome was an intimidating guy but there was a gleam in his gaze that was all about excitement and expectation i want you to hire some more staff i want dixie to have help on the floor and i want you to hire a fulltime day bartender thats good with the military guys and a night guy to give you a break i dont know that a break is the best thing for me you know what they say about idle hands i lifted both my eyebrows up at him as he scowled down at me from where he was most definitely looming this bar gave both of us a crutch to lean on when we were trying to figure out what we were doing with our lives its helped us both out by keeping us busy and given us something to focus on you more so than me because i had my halfpint and the baby to worry about i think its also offered me the insight into what happens next he looked at me to see if i was still with him and i was i couldnt disagree that the bar was a safe haven when i was trying to leave behind a life and turn into something someone more respectable there are a lot of businesses that could use a little revitalization a second chance if you will the gym i go to is falling apart it needs some new equipment some new blood to bring it into this century i like that the place feels like an old gym from the 1930s or something but it needs some help i want to invest in it i blinked in surprise and just stared at him he cocked the eyebrow with the scar in it at me and kept going nash has a buddy with a garage he does killer restoration projects but is pretty smalltime ive seen his work and met the guy a few times i think i want to funnel some cash into his enterprise as well i hissed out a whistle between my teeth man you werent kidding about a decent profit were you boss rome grunted at me i also want to help nash and rule out if they do decide to expand and open a third shop somewhere what i dont want to do is sit on my ass anymore and wait on whatever it is thats going to happen next to find me im buying a house im having another kid and when all thats said and done im marrying the most perfect girl in the world i didnt really think perfect and cora went together in the same sentence but to him she was absolutely the perfect choice and there was something to be said for feeling that way about the mother of your kids those are all good plans rome and i gotta say im a little shocked you decided that being an entrepreneur and investor was your calling but i can get behind you wanting to help out struggling businesses thats pretty noble of you he gave me a hard look second chances matter you and i both know that they do i worked hard every day to make sure my second chance wasnt wasted i owed myself and the people that loved me at least that much i want you to consider being my business partner you do a good job herefuck a great job youre way better with people than ill ever be and i think youre the only other person that can understand why i want to invest in the businesses i do well shit that was unexpected i scooted forward on the chair a little and raised my hand to rub vigorously at the back of my neck old shame and bitter regret surged to the surface and i had to try really hard to fight it back down i dont have that kind of money floating around big guy he paid me a fair salary and my cost of living was practically nil but when you died on an operating table and they brought you back to life it cost a fortune with no insurance that meant every extra cent i had went back to paying the medical bills that were astronomical ayden and jet had offered to help but as soon i settled into my job at the bar i refused to let them it was the first time in my life i was actually owning up to the consequences of my actions his mouth quirked and he pushed off the desk so that he was on his feet so give me a hundred bucks itll be the best money you ever spent i swore at him and got to my feet i still had to look up at him but he seemed less imposing now that i wasnt sitting down look i appreciate the offer and i would jump at the chance but i cant and i cant let you give me a free pass like that he opened his mouth to argue with me but i cut him off by putting a hand on his massive shoulder and shaking my head ive always taken any shortcut i could find when i didnt get shit handed to me i took it because i thought i was entitled to it i cant do that with you not after everything youve done for me rome if i ever get in a place where i can legitimately buy my way into a partnership with you and the offer is still there ill jump on board until then you just let me know if you need help with anything i can be your goto guy youve been that since the first day you started work here i cleared my throat as heavy gratitude pressed in on me from all directions thanks for trusting me enough to even consider getting into some kind of business with me he grunted and we both left the office youve never given me a reason not to trust you i know there was ugly shit before but that doesnt have anything to do with now ive had to learn to leave the past where it belongs or it really fucks up the good stuff happening in the here and now we were both pretty solemn as we walked back into the front of the bar brite was gone and dixie was standing behind the bar watching dash who insisted we all just call him church like rome did as he walked around straightening tables rome gave the cocktail waitress a onearmed hug and stuck his head in the kitchen to let darcy know he was leaving he also gave church a fist bump as the other darkskinned exmilitary man walked up to the bar and then looked at me with lifted eyebrows as he turned to go lemme know if you change your mind opie will do the nickname was ridiculous i was so far from being the innocent southern kid in overalls at the water hole it was laughable but a drunk kid had once lobbed the name as an insult and not surprisingly it stuck since it was a saturday night i ran through what we were looking at businesswise for the night and told both dixie and church that rome wanted to look for some more staff i told them if they had any recommendations to send them my way and then went into the kitchen to make sure avett had at least showed up for her shift she was standing by the big walkin cooler and darcy was in front of her the older woman had her daughters chin in her hand and was screaming at her i know goddamn well you did not trip and fall and give yourself that black eye avett avetts gaze darted anywhere but at her infuriated mother and landed on me i saw her bottom lip tremble and i frowned at her over the top of darcys head if hes putting marks on you that other people can see its only gonna get worse not only does that mean he doesnt give a shit about you it means he doesnt give a shit that you actually have people that might not want to see you hurt thats dangerous you should cut ties and run like a rabbit with its tail on fire avetts swirly eyes narrowed at me and she jerked away from her mom you dont know anything neither one of you do jared was drunk it was an accident leave me alone or ill walk out and you wont have anyone to work the busiest night of the week she was shaking and i knew she didnt believe her own words i could see it as she bit the inside of her cheek you had to be able to lie to yourself before you could lie expertly to other people avett wasnt quite there yet and maybe there was time to stop her before she got there i was done playing babysitter it was time to let the bad guy out and maybe he could get results where coddling this troubled girl had failed i told her flatly you walk out you arent walking back in im done playing your spoiledbrat games you dont wanna be here well guess what i really fucking dont want you here either but i owe your dad and your mom is a good lady so i endure working with you thisi waved a hand around the kitchen to encompass the dramatic scene i had interruptedis the threshold for my bullshit tolerance i made sure i looked at darcy so she could see how dead serious i was before i walked back out of the kitchen it was a busy saturday night even without a band but all the patrons seemed to be on their best behavior there was one little squabble among some girls but as soon as they saw church making his way over to where they were causing a ruckus they quieted down and went immediately into flirt mode i stayed busy until midnight when a scragglylooking dude walked in looking strung out and shifty i had the sinking suspicion he was here for avett he totally looked like the kind of scumbag that had no issue hitting women or asking them to steal from work he stayed just inside the front door and was twitchy enough that church hovered close by i was getting ready to round the bar and ask him what his deal was when avett came barreling out of the kitchen and rushed to the guys side he scowled at her and shrugged her off all while hauling her body out the front door i saw churchs eyebrows snap down in a fierce v and without me saying anything he followed the young couple into the parking lot at least we could stop the idiot from pounding on her while she was at work i made a mental note to mention something to brite he was the baddest of the bad and anything he would have to say to his daughters loser boyfriend would be far more effective and terrifying than anything i came up with can i have another lemon drop please my attention shifted back to the smiling lady that had been sitting at the bar since ten she was a tad bit older probably in her midforties but she was a looker i wasnt sure how much was natural versus how much was manmade but she had an amazing face and sleek blond hair and a look in her dark eyes that let me know she would like me to serve her more than a martini i thought it was funny since she was with a guy that looked younger than me and he was bending over backward to keep not only her attention but her obvious wealth focused on him he was glaring at me every time she tried to engage me in conversation so of course i had played it up all night i smiled back made sure to flex when i shook her drink and kissed the back of her fingers when she handed me a twenty for a tip i laughed under my breath when the guy turned beet red and looked like he was going to explode she was a classylooking chick but i wasnt into being mancandy so i took her money and fucked with her boy toy for my own amusement they werent our normal type of customer and i wondered where in the world they had wandered in from i was going to ask but got distracted by a blown keg i needed to change and by a couple that thought they could walk out on dixie without paying their tab i was tired by the time the bar was shut down and church was getting ready to walk dixie to her car they asked if i wanted them to wait for me but i needed a minute to decompress i had so much stuff floating around in my head romes offer avetts crappy boyfriend where my life really was going and of course royal i hadnt seen her since the hospital but she was back at work now so maybe that was enough to have her acting right instead of acting out i didnt want her to be all tangled up in my mind and my confusion but when i closed my eyes to go to bed at night i still tasted her wintercold lips against my own it was after three by the time i hit the lights and locked everything up i drank a couple fingers of scotch while listening to the raconteurs on the digital jukebox before hitting the back door then i shrugged into my coat for the walk home i was lucky it was close because i really didnt love colorado winter weather how february managed to be so much colder than either december or january still amazed my inherently southern bones with my hands in my pockets i put my head down against the bitter wind and started across the parking lot a soft feminine voice dropping really ugly swearwords brought me up short i blinked because i couldnt believe she was back at my bar in the middle of the night once again in gym clothes and looking all too delectable she was pacing in a very agitated manner and stopping to alternately kick the tire of her suv and thunk her forehead on the drivers window royal she jerked around when i said her name and gazed at me with dark and hypnotic eyes im not stalking you she stiffened as i made my way over to her she seemed automatically defensive i didnt think you were she sighed and let her head roll back to hit the window i couldnt sleep so i went to the gym that didnt help so i thought id stop and have a drink then i remembered you dont want me here so then i had to sit in the car for a few minutes and decide what i wanted to do but while i was doing that a really drunk girl came out of the convenience store over there she pointed to the little corner store across the street she was going to drive so i had to go over and say something her pretty mouth quirked up in a tiny grin i took her keys and waited until she got a cab only as usual i left my purse inside the 4runner along with my keys and phone she thunked her head back again and i wanted to reach out to pull her into a hug i locked myself out of my car i blew out a breath and it fogged in the air between us it was much like the last time we had been here only her hand wasnt around my dick and i wasnt pawing at her like a crazy person you dont keep a spare she rolled her eyes of course i do but not on the car im a cop that would just be asking for trouble or a pissedoff perp waiting for me in my backseat after a shift saint has one dom has one nash even has one but its three in the morning and i dont exactly want to make that call and piss everyone off besides dom is the one i would call and he cant exactly ride to my rescue right now i saw her gulp as she said it and her eyes darted away from mine i groaned and i knew she heard it come on you can come crash at my place and call the cavalry in the morning its cold and im too tired to try and figure out a smarter solution she cocked her head to the side and considered me for a long moment before asking smarter solution i took her by the elbow and felt her shiver i took my coat off again and wrapped her up in it someone needed to explain to her that it was fucking freezing outside and she needed to wear more than skintight workout gear if she was going to wander the streets at night you and me alone is the dumbest idea i ever had red dont say i didnt warn you chapter 6 royal i knew i could just ask him for his phone to call a cab and get a ride back to capitol hill i also knew nash would be happy to get up and come collect me even if it was well past the middle of the night but i had been angling for asa to take me home for weeks and if this was the only opportunity i was going to get then i was going to roll with it even if he looked more annoyed and agitated than amorous besides he had given me his coat again when the temperature was freezing cold and i knew somehow that meant something even if he wasnt aware of it how was going back to work his drawl was honeyed and warm as he guided me along the silent streets i dont think i knew anyone else that was a grownup yet didnt own a car it was just one more piece of the puzzle that was asa cross its been tricky ive never partnered with anyone but dominic so its strange being on patrol with someone new my temporary partner was a guy named barrett he was quite a bit older than me and most definitely the strong silent type i was used to letting dom take the lead to following his moves so it was strange trying to adjust to being the more vocal partner so far my shifts without dom had been pretty uneventful and i hadnt had to pull my gun or really wade into any danger i was dreading the day it happened even though the department shrink told me that was normal she was convinced i was suffering from some lowgrade ptsd symptoms and that my guilt at being distracted and seeing dom almost die was tied to the fact that i had escaped the shootout unscathed i leaned into asas side when i noticed that he was shivering in the cold a thrill raced through me when he wrapped his arm around my shoulder and huddled into me sure it was probably for warmth but my libido didnt care how is your partner doing i hated to think about dom being laid up and healing he was a guy that liked action that liked to be handson but in his current state all he could do was lie in bed and watch endless hours of netflix while his sisters hovered over him it also rankled me every time i put my uniform on that i was the one that got to go to work that i was the one who ended up all right while dom was the one stuck not knowing what his future was going to look like the unfairness of it all grated across my skin and sat heavy in my gut every single shift hes getting there hes going to need a lot of physical therapy once hes back in fighting form that broken femur is no joke if you need a name i know a guy i looked up at him from under my eyelashes you know a guy we reached a very nondescript and frankly crappy apartment complex and i followed him up a few flights of stairs this isnt ever where id picture him living well rome knows a guy he used to date romes younger brother rules twin remy his name is orlando fredrick and hes some bigshot sports physical therapist ive met him a few times when he popped into the bar to talk to rome he seems like a pretty cool guy and according to rome he knows his shit rome didnt strike me as the type that handed out praise or respect lightly so i made a mental note of the name to pass along to dom and followed asa into the apartment it was tiny really tiny and there wasnt much in it i mean it was a studio so there wasnt a lot of space to keep stuff but beyond the bed a decentsized flatscreen tv the little bistro set and a wellworn recliner there didnt seem to be any part of him in the apartment if he was concerned or interested in my slightly startled reaction to his place he didnt show it he flipped on the lights tossed his keys and his cell on the ittybitty little table and shoved his hands through his thick blond hair let me dig out some clean sheets and you can change the bed while i take a shower he inclined his head toward the chair ill crash in the recliner since i can sleep anywhere and you can take the bed i opened my mouth to argue it wasnt a kingsized bed but it was definitely big enough for both of us to share yet there was a glow in his gold eyes a warning light that had me clicking my teeth together in frustrated silence i always felt like he was trying to say something to me without words like he had an unspoken message for me i was just too thick to pick up on something was working behind those junglecat eyes and there was a coiled tension in him that i could feel vibrating and waiting to spring loose i shrugged out of his coat and hung it on the back of one of the chairs that sat at the table i took the sheets and blanket he shoved at me before he turned and headed to what i assumed was the bathroom i sank to the edge of the bed and stared blankly at the crackedopen door i set the bundle in my arms down next to me and tried to get my head around what was happening this was absolutely not what i had pictured coming home with the sexy southerner to be like i was sure once it was just the two of us alone the undeniable heat and chemistry that popped and sizzled between us would reach a bursting point then i would finally get all that i knew asa had to offer directed at me i wanted that smooth charm that effortless sexiness and all the turbulent desire i knew was lurking just below the surface of his goodolboy façade i sighed and looked at his abandoned cell phone wondering if i really should call someone to rescue me it was starting to seem like asas desire to save me from what he clearly thought was going to be a mistake was far stronger than my desire to make that mistake i got up and went to crack open the door to the bathroom enough that i could tell him i was going to call a cab and head home i wasnt going to kick him out of his bed when he obviously didnt want me here i already had enough things in my life making me feel bad about myself i didnt need to chase after more rejection from asa hey im just gonna  i trailed off as my tongue suddenly forgot how to work and all thought fled of course there wouldnt be a fullsized bath and shower in this tiny apartment just a shower stall enclosed in barely frosted glass that hid nothing the steam from the shower wasnt enough to obscure the sight before me and my hand pushed the door open the rest of the way like it was operating independently from the rest of me he had one arm bent above his head with his forehead resting on it as the water cascaded down around him he turned to look at me as the door opened even with the shower steam and the hazy glass between us i could see his brilliant gaze lock on mine as his other arm moved to work his fist up and down an impressive erection that was obviously meant for me i knew i should shut the door and turn away it was his space his private moment but i couldnt do it and i was equal parts turned on and furious watching him as he worked himself over all while he watched me unblinkingly he was beautiful it was beautiful yet i was so mad that after all the ways in which i had made it clear to him that he could have me he would rather selfgratify than take me to bed that i was having a hard time appreciating all that beauty even if i was transfixed by the sight he was wasting something that was rightfully mine and i wanted to scream at him to stop to ask me to join him under the water and put that throbbing evidence of his arousal to better use but i was stunned into silence rooted to the spot by twin spikes of passion and fury he was all long lean lines and taut golden skin his blond hair was slick shades darker from the water and his eyes shone out of his face like something was lighting them up from deep within him the muscles in his arm and across his broad shoulders flexed and danced as his hand moved over the thick impatientlooking arousal that hung prominently between his legs his defined abs contracted then released as he let out a long groan after a few more purposeful strokes brought him to completion his entire body jerked just a little and i could swear he mouthed my name as he came but that might have been wishful thinking on my part his fist relaxed and he blinked slowly at me while reaching out with a hand to push open the shower door we stared at each other for a long silent moment and i put a hand up to my throat because i felt like everything i wanted to say to him was stuck there you suck and i kind of hate you a lot right now my words were raspy and rough as i turned on my heel and stormed out of the bathroom making sure to slam the door behind me i wanted to choke him and fuck him not sure which desire was stronger i stalked to the table and snatched up the phone with every intention of getting out of this apartment away from him it was an emotional overload that i didnt want to make me do something i would end up regretting later when i was thinking more clearly the fact of the matter was i knew he had set me up had wanted me to walk in on him and see what he was doing the door was left open for a reason he had left me to stew as soon as we walked in the front door on purpose he was a calculating son of a bitch and i was really starting to see who he was under all the gloss and charm he hid behind most of the time asa wanted me to know that even though he wanted me he wasnt ever going to go there even when it was just us alone in his apartment his point had been made in a startlingly clear and vivid way and now i had to get away even if i would never ever forget the images he had imprinted on my mind forever of course the phone had a password on it which just amped up my frustration even further i stared at it blankly trying to figure out my next move when his fingers wrapped around my wrist and he pulled the useless device out of my hand he spun me around and absently tossed the phone back onto the table he was glaring down at me which maybe would have been intimidatingafter all i didnt really know asa that wellbut he hadnt bothered to put anything on not even a towel he was standing way too close and was way too naked for me to feel anything other than the damn lust he seemed to own as it rushed back to the surface we glowered at each other his fingers wrapped around my pulse where it thundered under his touch his mouth was in a hard line and water was running down his temples and across the smooth plane of his chest asa was a beautiful man when he was wearing worn jeans and an old tshirt naked and angry he looked like an ancient greek god visiting amongst us mere humans i jolted in surprise when he used his other hand to reach up and pull out the tie that was holding all my hair on top of my head in a messy knot the tangled strands fell haphazardly around my shoulders and i tilted my head back to look at him you have no idea what youre getting into with me royal his voice was always so rich and full of warm southern tones right now he sounded gruff and there was a tremor in it that made my heart stumble over itself yeah well im a big girl asa i should get the option to figure that out without you deciding it for me his fingers fluttered over my wrist then moved up to my elbow traveling farther up so that his palm smothered my shoulder and then he was cupping my jaw in his hand while rubbing his thumb along my bottom lip youre a cop like that was reason enough for him to keep fighting against this vortex of want and need that pulled at both of us i blew out a breath and lifted my own hand to wrap around his wrist i know but thats not all that i am the surrealness of having this conversation finally while he was naked and while i was still pretty pissed off at him made me dizzy maybe he was right maybe i didnt really understand what i was trying to get into with him a smirk kicked up the corner of his mouth and he took a step back from me he looked devilish and far too tempting youre mad at me i nodded in agreement i am that stunt in the shower was a dirty trick i know you planned it out you wanted me to see you you wanted me to know that even though ive been chasing you have made it clear that i want you  that you arent going to cross that line with me that was a total dick move at first i wanted him because he seemed like the perfect distraction to all the other stuff going wrong in my life then i had wanted him more because he was making it impossible to get him now i just wanted that was a whole lot of sexy naked man standing in front of me and any reason i might once have had for wanting to be with him seemed frivolous when faced with all his ridiculous masculine beauty he tilted his chin down just a hint just enough to let me know that i had hit his motivations right on the mark he held his arms out to the side lifted up both of his blond eyebrows in challenge and told me in a silky and seductive tone it shouldve been enough too bad it wasnt because i was thinking about you the entire time i dont know if were lucky or doomed that i never seem to be able to do the right thing for very long youve been after me for a minute red im not gonna cross the line but if you want to im not going to stop you anymore the storm ripped over the mountains gushing torrents of rain that struck the ground with the sharp ring of metal on stone lightning strikes spat down angry artillery fire that slammed against the cannon roar of thunder there was a gleeful kind of mean in the air a sizzle of temper and spite that boiled with power it suited malory prices mood perfectly hadnt she asked herself what else could go wrong now in answer to that weary and completely rhetorical question naturein all her maternal wrathwas showing her just how bad things could get there was an ominous rattling somewhere in the dash of her sweet little mazda and she still had nineteen payments to go on it in order to make those payments she had to keep

acquiring the promotion and the setup for showings and events the fact was shed begun to think of the gallery as hers and knew full well that the rest of the staff the clients the artists and craftsmen felt very much the same james p horace might have owned the smart little gallery but he never questioned malorys decisions and on his increasingly rare visits he complimented her always on the acquisitions the ambience the sales it had been perfect which was exactly what malory intended her life to be after all if it wasnt perfect what was the point everything had changed when james ditched fiftythree years of comfortable bachelorhood and acquired himself a young sexy wife a wife malory thought with her bluesteel eyes narrowing in resentment whod decided to make the gallery her personal pet it didnt matter that the new mrs horace knew next to nothing about art about business about public relations or about managing employees james doted on his pamela and malorys dream job had become a daily nightmare but shed been dealing with it malory thought as she scowled through her dark drenched windshield she had determined her strategy she would simply wait pamela out she would remain calm and selfpossessed until this nasty little bump was past and the road smoothed out again now that excellent strategy was out the window shed lost her temper when pamela countermanded her orders on a display of art glass and turned the perfectly and beautifully organized gallery upside down with clutter and ugly fabrics there were some things she could tolerate malory told herself but being slapped in the face with hideous taste in her own space wasnt one of them then again blowing up at the owners wife was not the path to job security particularly when the words myopic plebeian bimbo were employed lightning split the sky over the rise ahead and malory winced as much in memory of her temper as from the flash a very bad move on her part which only showed what happened when you gave in to temper and impulse to top it off shed spilled latte on pamelas escada suit but that had been an accident almost however fond james was of her malory knew her livelihood was hanging by a very slim thread and when the thread broke she would be sunk art galleries werent a dime a dozen in a pretty picturesque town like pleasant valley she would either have to find another area of work as a stopgap or relocate neither option put a smile on her face she loved pleasant valley loved being surrounded by the mountains of western pennsylvania she loved the smalltown feel the mix of quaint and sophisticated that drew the tourists and the getaway crowds that spilled out of neighboring pittsburgh for impulsive weekends even when she was a child growing up in the suburbs of pittsburgh pleasant valley was exactly the sort of place shed imagined living in she craved the hills with their shadows and textures and the tidy streets of a valley town the simplicity of the pace the friendliness of neighbors the decision to someday fold herself into the fabric of pleasant valley had been made when she was fourteen and spent a long holiday weekend there with her parents just as shed decided when she wandered through the gallery that longago autumn that she would one day be part of that space of course at the time she had thought her paintings would hang there but that was one item on her checklist that shed been forced to delete rather than tick off when it was accomplished she would never be an artist but she had to be needed to be involved with and surrounded by art still she didnt want to move back to the city she wanted to keep her gorgeous roomy apartment two blocks from the gallery with its views of the appalachians its creaky old floors and its walls that shed covered with carefully selected artwork but the hope of that was looking as dim as the stormy sky so she hadnt been smart with her money malory admitted with a windy sigh she didnt see the point of letting it lie in some bank when it could be turned into something lovely to look at or to wear until it was used money was just paper malory tended to use a great deal of paper she was overdrawn at the bank again shed maxed out her credit cards ditto but she reminded herself she had a great wardrobe and the start of a very impressive art collection which she would have to sell piece by piece and most likely at a loss to keep a roof over her head if pamela brought the axe down but maybe tonight would buy her some time and goodwill she hadnt wanted to attend the cocktail reception at warriors peak a fanciful name for a spooky old place she thought another time she wouldve been thrilled at the opportunity to see the inside of the great old house so high on the ridge and to rub elbows with people who might be patrons of the arts but the invitation had been oddwritten in an elegant hand on heavy stonecolored paper with a logo of an ornate gold key in lieu of letterhead though it was tucked in her evening bag now along with her compact her lipstick her cell phone her glasses a fresh pen business cards and ten dollars malory remembered the wording the pleasure of your company is desired for cocktails and conversation eight pm september 4 warriors peak you are the key the lock awaits now how weird was that malory asked herself and gritted her teeth as the car shimmied in a sudden gust of wind the way her luck was going it was probably a scam for a pyramid scheme the house had been empty for years she knew it had been purchased recently but the details were sparse an outfit called triad she recalled she assumed it was some sort of corporation looking to turn the place into a hotel or a mini resort which didnt explain why theyd invited the manager of the gallery but not the owner and his interfering wife pamela had been pretty peeved about the slightso that was something still malory would have passed on the evening she didnt have a datejust another aspect of her life that currently suckedand driving alone into the mountains to a house straight out of hollywood horror on the strength of an invitation that made her uneasy wasnt on her list of fun things to do in the middle of the workweek there hadnt even been a number or a contact for an rsvp and that she felt was arrogant and rude her intended response of ignoring the invitation would have been equally arrogant and rude but james had spotted the envelope on her desk hed been so excited so pleased by the idea of her going had pressed her to relay all the details of the houses interior to him and hed reminded her that if she could discreetly drop the name of the gallery into conversation from time to time it would be good for business if she could score a few clients it might offset the escada mishap and the bimbo comment her car chugged up the narrowing road that cut through the dense dark forest shed always thought of those hills and woods as a kind of sleepy hollow effect that ringed her pretty valley but just now with the wind and rain and dark the less serene aspects of that old tale were a little too much in evidence for her peace of mind if whatever was rattling in her dash was serious she could end up broken down on the side of the road huddled in the car listening to the moans and lashes of the storm and imagining headless horsemen while she waited for a tow truck she couldnt afford obviously the answer was not to break down she thought she caught glimpses of lights beaming through the rain and trees but her windshield wipers were whipping at the highest speed and were still barely able to shove aside the flood of rain as lightning snapped again she gripped the wheel tighter she liked a good hellcat storm as much as anyone but she wanted to enjoy this one from someplace inside anyplace while drinking a nice glass of wine she had to be close how far could any single road climb before it just had to start falling down the other side of the mountain she knew warriors peak stood atop the ridge guarding the valley below or lording itself over the valley depending on your viewpoint she hadnt passed another car for miles which only proved that anyone with half a brain wasnt out driving in this mess she thought the road forked and the bend on the right streamed between enormous stone pillars malory slowed gawked at the lifesize warriors standing on each pillar perhaps it was the storm the night or her own jittery mood but they looked more human than stone with hair flying around their fierce faces their hands gripping the hilts of their swords in the shimmer of lightning she could almost see muscles rippling in their arms over their broad bare chests she had to fight the temptation to get out of the car for a closer look but the chill that tripped down her spine as she turned through the open iron gates had her glancing back up at the warriors with as much wariness as appreciation for the skill of the sculptor then she hit the brakes and fishtailed on the crushed stone of the roadbed her heart jammed into her throat as she stared at the stunning buck standing arrogantly a foot in front of the bumper with the sprawling eccentric lines of the house behind him for a moment she took the deer for a sculpture as well though why any sane person would set a sculpture in the center of a driveway was beyond her then again sane didnt seem to be the operative word for anyone who would choose to live in the house on the ridge but the deers eyes gleamed a sharp sapphire blue in the beam of her headlights and his head with the great crowning rack turned slightly regally malory mused mesmerized rain streamed off his coat and in the next flash of light that coat seemed as white as the moon he stared at her but there was nothing of fear nothing of surprise in those glinting eyes there was if such things were possible a kind of amused disdain then he simply walked away through the curtain of rain the rivers of fog and was gone wow she let out a long breath shivered in the warmth of her car and one more wow she murmured as she stared at the house shed seen pictures of it and paintings shed seen its silhouette hulking on the ridge above the valley but it was an entirely different matter to see it up close with a storm raging something between a castle a fortress and a house of horrors she decided its stone was obsidian black with juts and towers peaks and battlements stacked and spread as if some very clever very wicked child had placed them at his whim against that rainslicked black long narrow windows perhaps hundreds of them all glowed with gilded light someone wasnt worried about his electric bill fog drifted around its base like a moat of mist in the next shock of lightning she caught a glimpse of a white banner with the gold key madly waving from one of the topmost spires she inched the car closer gargoyles hunched along the walls crawled over the eaves rainwater spewed out of their grinning mouths spilled from clawed hands as they grinned down at her she stopped the car in front of the stone skirt of a wide portico and considered very seriously turning back into the storm and driving away she called herself a coward a childish idiot she asked herself where shed lost her sense of adventure and fun the insults worked well enough that she soon was tapping her fingers on the cars door handle at the quick rap on her window a scream shot out of her throat the bony white face surrounded by a black hood that peered in at her turned the scream into a kind of breathless keening gargoyles do not come to life she assured herself repeating the words over and over in her head as she rolled the window down a cautious half inch welcome to warriors peak his voice boomed over the rain and his welcoming smile showed a great many teeth if youll just leave your keys in the car miss ill see to it for you before she could think to slap down the locks hed pulled her door open he blocked the sweep of wind and rain with his body and the biggest umbrella shed ever seen ill see you safe and dry to the door what was that accent english irish scots thank you she started to climb out felt herself pinned back panic dribbled into embarrassment as she realized she had yet to unhook her seat belt freed she huddled under the umbrella struggling to regulate her breathing as he walked her to the double entrance doors they were wide enough to accommodate a semi and boasted dull silver knockers big as turkey platters fashioned into dragons heads some welcome malory thought an instant before one of the doors opened and light and warmth poured out the woman had a straight and gorgeous stream of flamecolored hairit spilled around a pale face of perfect angles and curves her green eyes danced as if at some private joke she was tall and slim garbed in a long gown of fluid black a silver amulet holding a fat clear stone hung between her brsts her lips as red as her hair curved as she held out a hand sparkling with rings she looked malory thought like someone out of a very sexy faerie tale miss price welcome such a thrilling storm but distressing im sure to be out in it come in the hand was warm and strong and stayed clasped over malorys as the woman drew her into the entrance hall the light showered down from a chandelier of crystal so fine that it resembled spun sugar sparkling over the twists and curves of silver the floor was mosaic depicting the warriors from the gate and what seemed to be a number of mythological figures she couldnt kneel down and study it as she might have liked and was already struggling to hold back an orgasmic moan at the paintings that crowded walls the color of melted butter im so glad you could join us tonight the woman continued im rowena please let me take you into the parlor theres a lovely fire early in the year for one but the storm seemed to call for it was the drive difficult challenging miss rowena just rowena rowena i wonder if i could take a moment to freshen up before joining the other guests of course powder room she gestured to a door tucked under the long sweep of the front stairs the parlor is the first door on your right take your time thank you malory slipped inside and immediately decided that powder room was a very poor label for the plush spacious area the half dozen candles on the marble counter streamed out light and scent burgundy hand towels edged in ecru lace were arranged beside the generous pool of the sink the faucet gleamed gold in the fanciful shape of a swan here the floor mosaic showed a mermaid sitting on a rock smiling out at a blue sea as she combed her flamecolored hair this time after doublechecking to make certain that shed locked the door malory did kneel down to study the craftsmanship gorgeous she thought running her fingertips over the tiles old certainly and brilliantly executed was there anything more powerful than the ability to create beauty she straightened washed her hands with soap that smelled faintly of rosemary she took a moment to admire the collection of waterhouses nymphs and sirens framed on the walls before digging out her compact there was little she could do for her hair though shed drawn it back and anchored it at her nape with a rhinestone clip the weather had played havoc with the dark blond curls it was a look she thought as she dusted her nose sort of arty and carefree not elegant like the redhead but it suited her well enough she reapplied her lipstick satisfied that the pale rose had been a good investment subtle worked best with her milkmaid coloring shed paid too much for the cocktail suit of course but a woman was entitled to a few weaknesses she reminded herself as she straightened the slim satin lapels besides the slate blue was right for her eyes and the tailored lines pulled it all together into a style both professional and elegant she closed her bag lifted her chin okay mal lets go drum up some business she stepped out forced herself not to tiptoe back down the hall to drool over the paintings her heels clicked briskly on the tile she always enjoyed the sound of it powerful female and when she stepped through the first arch to the right the thrilled gasp escaped before she could block it shed never seen its like in or out of a museum antiques so lovingly tended that their surfaces gleamed like mirrors the rich deep colors that demonstrated an artists flair rugs pillows and draperies that were as much art forms as the paintings and statuary were on the far wall was a fireplace she could have stood in with her arms stretched out at her sides framed in malachite it held enormous logs that snapped with tongues of red and gold fire this was the perfect setting for a woman who looked like shed stepped out of a faerie tale she wanted to spend hours there to wallow in all that marvelous color and light the uneasy woman who had huddled in her car in the rain was long forgotten it took five minutes for my eyes to stop bugging out of my head after i walked in malory jolted then turned and stared at the woman who stood framed in the side window this one was a brunette with dense brown hair skimming between her jawline and shoulders in a stylish swing she was perhaps six full inches taller than malorys compact fivefour and had the lush curves to match the height both were set off with trim black pants and a kneelength jacket worn over a snug white top she held a champagne flute in one hand and extended the other as she walked across the room malory saw that her eyes were deep dark brown and direct her nose was narrow and straight her mouth wide and unpainted the faintest hint of dimples fluttered in her cheek when she smiled im dana dana steele malory price nice to meet you great jacket thanks i was pretty relieved when i saw you drive up its a hell of a place but i was getting a little spooked rattling around by myself its nearly quarter after she tapped the face of her watch youd think some of the other guests would be here by now wheres the woman who met me at the door rowena dana pursed her lips as she glanced back toward the archway she glides in and out looking gorgeous and mysterious im told our host will be joining us shortly who is our host your guess is as good as mine havent i seen you dana added in the valley possibly i manage the gallery for the time being she thought thats it ive come to a couple of showings there and sometimes i just wander in and look around avariciously im at the library a reference librarian they both turned as rowena walked in though glided in malory thought was a better description i see youve introduced yourselves lovely what can i get you to drink miss price ill have what shes having perfect even as she spoke a uniformed maid came in bearing two flutes on a silver tray please help yourselves to the canapés and make yourselves at home i hope the weather isnt keeping your other guests away dana put in rowena merely smiled im sure everyone whos expected will be here shortly if youll excuse me just another moment okay this is just weird dana picked a canapé at random discovered it was a lobster puff delicious but weird fascinating malory sipped her champagne and trailed her fingers over a bronze sculpture of a reclining faerie im still trying to figure out why i got an invitation since they were there and so was she dana sampled another canapé no one else at the library got one no one else i know got one for that matter im starting to wish id talked my brother into coming with me after all hes got a good bullshit barometer malory found herself grinning you dont sound like any librarian ive ever known you dont look like one either i burned all my laura ashley ten years ago dana gave a little shrug restless moving toward irritated she tapped her fingers on the crystal flute im going to give this about ten more minutes then im booking if you go i go id feel better heading back into that storm if i drove to the valley behind someone else same goes dana frowned toward the window watched the rain beat on the other side of the glass crappy night and it was an extremely crappy day driving all the way here and back in this mess for a couple of glasses of wine and some canapés just about caps it you too malory wandered toward a wonderful painting of a masked ball it made her think of paris though shed never been there except in her dreams i only came tonight in hopes of making some contacts for the gallery job insurance she added lifting her glass in a mock toast as my job is currently in a very precarious state mine too between budget cuts and nepotism my position was adjusted my hours trimmed back to twentyfive a week how the hell am i supposed to live on that and my landlord just announced that my rents going up first of next month theres a rattle in my carand i spent my automaintenance budget on these shoes dana looked down pursed her lips terrific shoes my computer crashed this morning enjoying herself malory turned away from the painting and raised a brow at dana i called my bosss new wife a bimbo and then spilled latte on her designer suit okay you win in the spirit of good fellowship dana stepped over and clinked her glass against malorys what do you say we hunt up the welsh goddess and find out whats going on around here is that what the accent is welsh gorgeous isnt it but be that as it may i think    she trailed off as they heard that distinctive click of high heels on tile the first thing malory noticed was the hair it was black and short with thick bangs cut so blunt they might have required a ruler beneath them the tawny eyes were large and long making her think of waterhouse again and his faeries she had a triangular face glowing with what might have been excitement nerves or excellent cosmetics the way her fingers kneaded at her little black bag malory went with the nerves she wore red stoplight red in an abbreviated dress that clung to her curvy body and showed off terrific legs the heels that had clicked along the tile were a good four inches high and sharp as stilettos hi her voice was breathy and her gaze was already flicking around the room um she said i should come right in join the party such as it is dana steele and my equally baffled companion this evening malory price im zoe mccourt she took another cautious step into the room as if she was waiting for someone to tell her thered been a mistake and boot her out again holy cow this place its like a movie its um beautiful and all but i keep expecting that scary guy in the smoking jacket to come in vincent price no relation malory said with a grin i take it you dont know any more about whats going on than we do no i think i got invited by mistake but she broke off ogling a bit when a servant entered with another flute on a tray ah    thanks she took the crystal gingerly then just smiled down at the bubbling wine champagne it has to be a mistake but i couldnt pass up the chance to come where is everybody else good question dana angled her head charmed and amused as zoe took a small testing sip of champagne are you from the valley yes well for the last couple years three for three malory murmured do you know anyone else who got an invitation for tonight no in fact i asked around which is probably why i got fired today is that food just to take you got fired malory exchanged a look with dana three for three carlyshe owns the salon where i work worked zoe corrected herself and walked toward a tray of canapés she heard me talking about it with one of my customers and got bent out of shape boy these are terrific her voice had lost its breathiness now and as she appeared to relax malory detected the faintest hint of twang anyway carlys been gunning for me for months i guess the invite seeing as she didnt get one put her nose out of joint next thing i know shes saying theres twenty missing from the till i never stole anything in my life bitch she took another more enthusiastic gulp of champagne and then bam im out on my ear doesnt matter its not going to matter ill get another job i hated working there anyway god it mattered malory thought the sparkle in zoes eyes that had as much fear to it as anger said it mattered a great deal youre a hairdresser yeah hair and skin consultant if you want to get snooty im not the type who gets invited to fancy parties at fancy places so i guess its a mistake considering malory shook her head i dont think someone like rowena makes mistakes ever well i dont know i wasnt going to come then i thought it would cheer me up then my car wouldnt start again i had to borrow the babysitters you have a baby dana asked hes not a baby anymore simons nine hes great i wouldnt worry about the job but ive got a kid to support and i didnt steal any goddamn twenty dollarsor twenty cents for that matter im not a thief she caught herself flushed scarlet sorry im sorry bubbles loosening my tongue i guess dont worry about it dana rubbed a hand up and down zoes arm you want to hear something strange my job and my paycheck just got cut to the bone i dont know what the hell im going to do and malory thinks shes about to get the axe at her job really zoe looked from one face to the other thats just weird and nobody we know was invited here tonight with a wary glance toward the doorway malory lowered her voice from the looks of things were it im a librarian youre a hairdresser she runs an art gallery what do we have in common were all out of work malory frowned or the next thing to it that alone is strange when you consider the valleys got a population of about five thousand what are the odds of three women hitting a professional wall the same day in the same little town next were all from the valley were all female about the same age twentyeight twentyseven dana said twentysixtwentyseven in december zoe shivered this is just too strange her eyes widened as she looked at her halfempty glass and she set it hastily aside you dont think theres anything in there that shouldnt be do you i dont think were going to be drugged and sold into white slavery danas tone was dry but she set her glass down as well people know were here right my brother knows where i am and people at work my boss his wife your exboss malory said to zoe your babysitter anyway this is pennsylvania for gods sake not i dont know zimbabwe i say we go find the mysterious rowena and get some answers we stick together right dana nodded at malory then zoe zoe swallowed honey im your new best friend to seal it she took danas hand then malorys how lovely to see you their hands were still joined as they turned and looked at the man who stood in the archway he smiled stepped inside the room welcome to warriors peak chapter two   for a moment malory thought one of the warriors from the gate had come to life he had the same fierce male beauty in his face the same powerful build his hair black as the storm waved back in wings from that strong sculpted face his eyes were midnight blue she felt the power of them a flash of heat along her skin when they met hers she wasnt a fanciful woman anything but she told herself but the storm the house the sheer ferocity of that gaze made her feel as though he could see everything in her mind everything that had ever been in her mind then his gaze left hers and the moment passed i am pitte thank you for gracing what is for now our home he took malorys free hand lifted it to his lips his touch was cool the gesture both courtly and dignified miss price she felt zoes fingers go lax on hers then pitte was moving to her lifting her fingers in turn miss mccourt and danas miss steele a boom of thunder had malory jolting and her hand groped for zoes again he was just a man she assured herself it was just a house and someone had to get everything back on an even keel you have an interesting home mr pitte she managed yes wont you sit ah rowena youve met my companion he took rowenas arm when she came to his side they fit malory decided like two halves of a coin by the fire i think rowena said gesturing toward the fireplace such a fierce night lets be comfortable i think wed be more comfortable if we understood whats going on dana planted her highheeled boots and stood her ground why we were asked here certainly but the fires so lovely theres nothing quite like good champagne good fellowship and a nice fire on a stormy night tell me miss price what do you think of what youve seen of our art collection impressive eclectic with a glance back at dana malory let rowena lead her toward a chair near the fire you must have spent considerable time on it rowenas laugh rippled like fog over water oh considerable pitte and i appreciate beauty in all its forms in fact you could say we revere it as you must given your choice of profession art is its own reason yes its the light in every shadow and pitte we must make certain miss steele sees the library before the evenings over i hope youll approve she gestured absently at the servant who entered with a crystal champagne bucket what would the world be without books books are the world curious cautious dana sat i think theres been a mistake zoe hung back looking from face to face i dont know anything about art not real art and booksi mean i read but please sit pitte nudged her gently into a chair be at home i trust your son is well she stiffened and those tawny eyes went tigerbright simons fine motherhoods a kind of art dont you think miss mccourt a work in progress of the most essential most vital kind one that requires valor and heart do you have children no i havent been given that gift his hand brushed rowenas as he spoke then he lifted his glass to life and all its mysteries his eyes gleamed over the rim of the glass theres no need to fear no one here wishes you anything but health happiness and success why dana demanded you dont know us though you seem to know a great deal more about us than we do about you youre a seeker miss steele an intelligent straightforward woman who looks for answers im not getting any he smiled its my fondest hope that youll find all the answers to begin id like to tell you a story it seems a night for stories he settled back like rowenas his voice was musical and strong faintly exotic the sort malory thought designed for telling tales on stormy nights because of it she relaxed a little what else did she have to do after all besides sit in a fantastic house by a roaring fire and listen to a strange handsome man weave a tale while she sipped champagne it beat eating takeout while reconciling her checkbook hands down and if she could wheedle a tour of the place and nudge pitte toward the gallery as a vehicle to expand his art collection she might just save her job so she settled back as well and prepared to enjoy herself long ago in a land of great mountains and rich forests lived a young god he was his parents only child and well beloved he was gifted with a handsome face and strength of heart and muscle he was destined to rule one day as his father before him and so he was reared to be the godking cool in judgment swift in action there was peace in this world since gods had walked there beauty music and art stories and dance were everywhere for as long as memoryand a gods memory is infinitethere had been harmony and balance in this place he paused to sip his wine his gaze tracking slowly from face to face from behind the curtain of power through the veil of the curtain of dreams they would look on the world of mortals lesser gods were permitted to mix and mate with those of the mortal realm at their whim and so became the faeries and sprites the sylphs and other creatures of magic some found the mortal world more to their tastes and peopled it some of course were corrupted by the powers by the world of mortals and turned to darker ways such is the way of nature even of gods pitte eased forward to top a thin cracker with caviar youve heard stories of magic and sorcery the faerie tales and fantasies as one of the guardians of stories and books miss steele do you consider how such tales become part of the culture what root of truth they spring from to give someone or something a power greater than our own to feed our need for heroes and villains and romance dana shrugged though she was already fascinated if for instance arthur of the celts existed as a warrior king as many scholars and scientists believe how much more enthralling more potent is his image if we see him in camelot with merlin if he was conceived with the aid of sorcery and crowned high king as a young boy who pulled a magic sword out of a stone i love that story zoe put in well except for the end it seemed so unfair but i think    please pitte said go on well i sort of think that maybe magic did exist once before we educated ourselves out of it i dont mean educations bad she said quickly squirming as everyones attention focused on her i just mean maybe we um locked it away because we started needing logical and scientific answers for everything well said rowena nodded a child often tucks his toys in the back of the closet forgetting the wonder of them as he grows to manhood do you believe in wonder miss mccourt i have a nineyearold son zoe replied all i have to do is look at him to believe in wonder i wish youd call me zoe rowenas face lit with warmth thank you pitte ah yes to continue the tale as was the tradition upon reaching his majority the young god was sent beyond the curtain for one week to walk among the mortals to learn their ways to study their weaknesses and strengths their virtues and flaws it happened that he saw a young woman a maid of great beauty and virtue and seeing loved and loving wanted and though she was denied to him by the rules of his world he pined for her he grew listless restless unhappy he would not eat or drink nor did he find any appeal in all the young goddesses offered to him his parents disturbed at seeing their son so distressed weakened they would not give their son to the mortal world but they brought the maid to theirs they kidnapped her malory interrupted they could have done rowena filled the flutes again but love cannot be stolen its a choice and the young god wished for love did he get it zoe wondered the mortal maid chose and loved and gave up her world for his pitte rested his hands on his knees there was anger in the worlds of gods of mortals and in that mystical halfworld of the faeries no mortal was to pass through the curtain yet that most essential rule was now broken a mortal woman had been taken from her world and into theirs married to and bedded by their future king for no reason more important than love whats more important than love malory asked and earned a slow quiet look from pitte some would say nothing others would say honor truth loyalty others did and for the first time in the memory of the gods there was dissension rebellion the balance was shaken the young godking crowned now was strong and withstood this and the mortal maid was beautiful and true some were swayed to accept her and others plotted in secret there was a whip of outrage in his voice and a sudden cold fierceness that made malory think of the stone warriors again battles fought in the open could be quelled but others were devised in secret chambers and these ate at the foundation of the world it came to pass that the godkings wife bore three children three daughters demigoddesses with mortal souls on their birth their father gifted each with a jeweled amulet for protection they learned the ways of their fathers world and of their mothers their beauty their innocence softened many hearts turned many minds for some years there was peace again and the daughters grew to young women devoted to each other each with a talent that enhanced and completed those of her sisters he paused again as if gathering himself they harmed no one brought only light and beauty to both sides of the curtain but there remained shadows one coveted what they had that no god could claim through sorcery through envy despite all precautions they were taken into the halfworld the spell cast plunged them into eternal sleep a living death and sleeping they were sent back through the curtain their mortal souls locked in a box that has three keys not even their fathers power can break the locks until the keys turn one by two by three the daughters are trapped in an enchanted sleep and their souls weep in a prison of glass where are the keys malory asked and why cant the box be opened by enchantment since it was locked by it where they are is a puzzle many magicks and spells have been cast to unlock the box all have failedbut there are clues the souls are mortal and only mortal hands can turn the keys my invitation said i was the key malory glanced at dana and zoe got nods of confirmation what do we have to do with some mythological legend i have something to show you pitte rose gestured toward the archway i hope it interests you the storms getting worse zoe sent a wary look toward the windows i need to start home please indulge me well all leave together malory gave zoes arm a reassuring squeeze lets just see what it is he wants to show us first i hope youll invite me back at some point she continued as she walked to the doorway to join pitte and rowena id very much like to see more of your art collection and perhaps repay the favor by giving you a private tour of the gallery youll certainly be welcome back pitte took her arm lightly and led her down the wide hall it would be a pleasure for rowena and me to discuss our collection with someone who understands and appreciates it he turned toward another archway i hope youll understand and appreciate this particular piece of it over another fireplace that roared with flame was a painting that towered to the ceiling the colors were so vivid so rich the style so bold and strong that malorys art lovers heart took one fast leap the portrait was of three women young beautiful in flowing gowns of sapphire of ruby of emerald the one in blue with golden curls rioting to her waist sat on a bench that circled a pool she held a small gold harp seated on the silver tiles at her feet the girl in red had a scroll and quill in her lap and her hand on her sistersfor surely they were sistersknee beside them the girl in green stood a chubby black puppy in the crook of her arm and a short silver sword at her hip a heartbreak of flowers spilled around them there were trees with jeweled fruit dripping from the branches and in the cerulean sky both birds and faeries were on the wing enthralled malory was halfway across the room for a closer look when her heart gave another harder knock the girl in blue had her face younger she thought as she came to an abrupt halt certainly more beautiful the skin was luminous the eyes deeper bluer the hair more luxurious and romantic but there was no mistaking the power of the resemblance nor she saw as she steadied herself the resemblance between the others in the portrait and the other two guests at warriors peak magnificent work a masters work malory said and was amazed at how calm her voice sounded through the buzzing in her ears they look like us there was wonder in the words as zoe moved beside malory how can they good question and suspicion in danas how did the three of us come to be used as models for what is obviously a portrait of the three sisters in the story you just told us it was painted before you were born before your parents your grandparents and those who sired them were born rowena walked toward the portrait stood below it with her hands folded at her waist its age can be verified through tests isnt that so malory yes its approximate age can be authenticated but whatever its age you havent answered zoes question the smile that spread on rowenas face seemed to hold both approval and amusement no i havent what else do you see in the painting malory reached in her purse took out a pair of blackframed rectangular glasses she slipped them on and made a more thorough study a key in the right corner of the sky it seems to be a bird until you look closely a second one there on the branch of a tree almost hidden by the leaves and fruit and the third just visible under the surface of the pool theres a shadow there in the trees in the form of a man maybe a woman just the hint of something dark watching them another shadow just sliding onto the silver tile at the edge a snake ah and here in the far background she lost herself in the painting forgot herself and stepped up onto the hearth theres a couplea man and a womanembracing the woman is robed richly with the purple symbolizing a woman of rank and the man is garbed like a soldier a warrior theres a raven in the tree just above them a symbol of impending doom just as the sky here is darker with storm lights a threat the sisters are unaware of the threat they look forward grouped together the crown of their ranks glinting in the sunlight that washes this area of the foreground theres a sense of companionship and affection between them and the white dove here on the edge of the pool is their purity each wears an amulet the same shape and size with the jewel reflecting the color of their gown they are a unit yet individuals its magnificent work you can almost see them breathe you have a discerning eye pitte touched rowenas arm as he nodded at malory its the prize of the collection and still dana pointed out you havent answered the question magick couldnt break the spell that locked the souls of the kings daughters in a box of glass sorcerers were called and wizards and witches from all the worlds but no magicks could unbind the curse so another was cast in this world in every generation three women are born who will come together in one place at one time they are not sisters they are not gods but mortal women and they are the only ones who can release the innocents and you want us to believe that were those women danas brows arched there was a tickle in her throat but it didnt feel like laughter that we just happen to look like the women in this painting nothing just happens and whether you believe or not changes little pitte held out his hands toward them you are the chosen and i am charged to tell you well youve told us so now and to make you this offer he continued before dana could finish you will each have in turn one phase of the moon to find one of the three keys if within the twentyeight days the first fails the matter is done if the first succeeds the seconds time begins but if the second fails within her time the matter is done if all three keys are brought to this place before the end of the third moon you will be given a boon what sort of boon zoe asked one million dollars each get out of town dana snorted then stared at her two companions oh come on ladies this is just screwy easy for him to toss money around like confetti when wed be off on some wildgoose chase for a trio of keys that dont exist in the first place and if they did her eyes brilliant zoe turned toward dana if they did wouldnt you want a chance to find them the chance for that kind of money what chance its a great big world out there how do you expect to find a little gold key you will be given each in turn a guide rowena gestured to a small chest this we can do if all agree you may work together in fact we hope that you will you must all agree if one refuses the challenge its done if all accept the challenge and the terms youll each be given twentyfive thousand dollars it remains yours whether you fail or succeed wait a minute wait a minute malory held up a hand then pulled off her glasses wait a minute she repeated youre saying if we agree to look for these keys just to look for them we get twentyfive k free and clear the amount will be deposited in an account of your choosing immediately pitte stated oh my god zoe clasped her hands oh my god she repeated and sat down heavily this has got to be a dream a scam you mean whats the catch dana questioned whats the fine print if you fail any one of you the penalty for all will be a year of your lives what like in jail malory demanded no rowena motioned to a servant to enter with a coffee cart a year of your life will not exist poof dana snapped her fingers like magic the keys exist not in this house rowena murmured but in this world this place this we are able to do more we are not allowed to say although we may offer a little guidance the quest isnt simple so you will be rewarded for the attempt should you succeed the reward is greater should you fail there is penalty please take this time to discuss it pitte and i will give you some privacy they walked out of the room and rowena turned back to slide the wide pocket doors shut this dana said as she plucked a tiny cream puff from the dessert tray is a nuthouse and if either of you is actually considering playing along with these fruitcakes you belong in this nuthouse let me just say one thing malory poured a cup of coffee stirred in two lumps of sugar twentyfive thousand dollars each you dont really believe theyre going to plunk down seventyfive large because we say oh sure well look for the keys the ones that unlock the box holding the souls of a trio of demigoddesses malory debated over a mini éclair only one way to find out they look like us ignoring the coffee and pastries zoe stood beneath the painting staring up so much like us yes they do and thats just creepy dana nodded when malory held up the coffeepot why paint the three of us together that way weve never met before tonight and the idea of somebody watching us taking pictures or sketches or whatever so they could put this portrait together spooks me it wasnt something painted on a whim or quickly malory handed dana the coffee cup its a masterpiecethe skill the scope the detail someone poured himself or herself into that piece someone with incredible talent and it took an incredible amount of work if this is a scam its an elaborate one plus whats the point im broke you dana puffed out her cheeks close enough ive got some savings zoe put in but im going to go through them pretty quick if i dont get another job and fast i dont know a lot about it but it doesnt look like these people would be after the little bit of money weve got agreed you want some coffee thanks she turned back to them and spread her hands look you all dont know me and youve got no reason to care but i could really use this money zoe came forward twentyfive thousand would be like a miracle security for my son a chance maybe to do what ive always wanted have my own little salon all we have to do is say yes so we look for some keys its not illegal there are no keys dana insisted what if there are zoe put her cup down without drinking i have to say the idea of twentyfive thousand dollars really helps open my mind to possibilities and a million she gave a quick baffled laugh i cant even think about it it makes my stomach hurt itd be like a treasure hunt malory murmured it could be fun god knows it could be profitable twentyfive thousand would really close the gap for me and thats a very practical priority just now i might be able to have my own place too not like the gallery but just a little place that spotlights artists and craftspeople it was a full ten years before that was due in the order of her life plan but she could be flexible nothings that simple nobody hands you money because you say youll do something dana shook her head theres got to be more under all this maybe they believe it the story malory added if you believed it twentyfive thousand would be chump change were talking souls here unable to help herself she looked back at the portrait a souls worth more than twentyfive thousand dollars excitement bounced inside her like a bright red ball shed never had an adventure certainly not a paying adventure theyve got money theyre eccentric and they believe it the fact is going along with it sort of feels like were the ones pulling the scam but im going to get over that youll do it zoe grabbed her arm youre going to do it its not every day you get paid to work for the gods come on dana loosen up danas brows drew together her forehead forming a stubborn vertical line between them its asking for trouble i dont know where or how but it just feels like trouble what would you do with twentyfive thousand malory purred it then offered another cream puff invest what i could so i could have my own little bookstore her sigh was wistful and a sign that she was weakening id serve tea in the afternoons wine in the evenings have readings oh boy its strange how were all having a job crisis and that the thing we all want is to have our own place zoe sent a wary look at the portrait again dont you think its strange no more strange than being here in this fortress and talking about going on a treasure hunt well im in a fix dana muttered i say no it kills it for both of you saying yes makes me feel like an idiot i guess im an idiot yes with a hoot of laughter zoe threw her arms around dana this is great this is amazing take it easy chuckling dana patted zoe on the back i guess this is the time to pull out the right quote one for all and all for one  i got a better one malory picked up her cup again lifted it in a toast  show me the money  as if on cue the doors opened rowena entered first shall we sit weve decided to accept the    zoe trailed off looked at dana the challenge yes rowena crossed her legs youll want to look over the contracts contracts malory echoed naturally a name has power the writing of ones name the promise of it is necessary for all once youre satisfied well select for the first key pitte took papers out of a desk handed one set to each woman theyre simple i believe and cover the terms already discussed if youll write in where you wish the money to be sent it will be done doesnt it matter to you that we dont believe in them malory lifted a hand toward the portrait youll give your word that youll accept the terms thats enough for now rowena told her pretty straightforward for such an odd business dana commented and promised herself she would take the contract to a lawyer the next day to see if it was binding pitte handed her a pen as you are straightforward if and when your turn comes i know youll do all you can lightning sizzled along the window glass as the contracts were signed then countersigned you are the chosen rowena said as she rose again now its in your hands pitte he walked back to the desk picked up a carved box inside are three disks one has a figure of a key the one who chooses that disk begins the quest i hope its not me with a shaky laugh zoe wiped her damp palms on her skirt im sorry im just really nervous she closed her eyes reached into the box keeping the disk clutched in her fist she looked at malory and dana lets all look at the same time okay fine here goes dana reached in kept the disk palmed against her side as malory reached for the final one okay they stood in a circle facing each other then held out the disks wow malory cleared her throat lucky me she whispered as she saw the gold key etched into the white disk she had selected you are the first rowena said walking to her your time starts at sunrise tomorrow and ends at midnight on the twentyeighth day thereafter but i get a guide right a map or something rowena opened the small chest and withdrew a paper which she offered to malory she then spoke the words written on it you must seek beauty and truth and courage one alone will never stand two without the third is incomplete search within and know what you have yet to know find what the dark covets most search without where the light conquers shadows as love conquers sorrow silver tears fall for the song she makes there for it springs from souls look beyond and between see where beauty blooms and the goddess sings there may be fear there may be grief but the true heart vanquishes both when you find what you seek love will break the spell and the heart will forge the key and bring it to light malory waited a beat thats it thats supposed to be a clue im so glad i didnt have to go first zoe said waitcant you tell me anything else you and pitte already know where the keys are right this is all we are allowed to give you but you have all you need to have rowena laid her hands on malorys shoulders then kissed her cheeks blessings on you later rowena stood letting the fire warm her hands as she stared up at the painting she felt pitte come in to stand behind her turned her face into his hand when he touched her cheek i had higher hopes before they came he told her theyre bright resourceful none are chosen who arent capable yet we remain in this place year by century by millennium dont she turned slid her arms around his waist pressed herself to him dont despair my dearest love before it really begins so many beginnings but never an end he bent his head touched his lips to her brow how this place crowds me weve done all that can be done she laid her cheek on his chest comforted by the steady sound of his heartbeat have a little faith i liked them she added and took his hand as they started toward the doors theyre interesting enough for mortals he replied as they passed through the archway the roaring fire vanished and the lights snapped off leaving behind a trail of gold in the dark chapter three   she couldnt say she hadnt seen it coming and james was certainly gentle even paternal but the boot was the boot however it was administered being prepared even having the miraculous cushion of the twentyfive thousand dollars now tucked away in her accounta fact that she had confirmed that morningdidnt make being fired any less horrible and humiliating things change james p horace natty as always in his bow tie and rimless glasses spoke in modulated tones in all the years malory had known him shed never heard him raise his voice he could be absentminded occasionally negligent about practicalities when it came to business but he was unfailingly kind even now his face held a patient and serene expression a little like an aged cherub malory thought though the office door was closed the rest of the gallerys staff would know very shortly the outcome of the meeting i like to think of myself as a kind of surrogate father and as such i want only the best for you yes james but if we dont move in some direction we stand still i feel that though this may be difficult for you initially malory youll soon see its the best thing that could happen how many clichés malory wondered could one man use when lowering the boom james i know pamela and i havent seen eye to eye ill see your cliché and raise you as the new kid on the block shes bound to be a bit defensive while i tend to be territorial im so terribly sorry i lost my temper spilling the coffee was an accident you know id never now now he waved his hands in the air im sure it was i dont want you to give that another thought water under the bridge but the point is malory pamela wants to take a more active role in the business to shake things up a bit desperation slithered into her belly james she moved everything in the main room jumbled pieces in from the salon she brought fabric ingold lamé jamesand draped it over the deco nude like a sarong not only was the flow interrupted by the placements but the result was well just tacky she doesnt understand art and space she yes yes his voice never changed pitch his face never altered its placid expression but shell learn and i believe that teaching her will be enjoyable i appreciate her interest in my business and her enthusiasmjust as ive always appreciated yours malory but the fact is i really think youve outgrown us here its time for you to stretch yourself broaden your horizons take some risks her throat closed and her voice sounded thick when she managed to speak i love the gallery james i know you do and youre always welcome here i feel its time for me to give you a nudge out of the nest naturally i want you to be comfortable while youre deciding what youd like to do next he took a check out of his breast pocket a months severance should help keep the wolf from the door what will i do where will i go frantic questions flew around her brain like terrified birds this is the only place ive ever worked which makes my point he set the check on the desk i hope you know how fond i am of you and that you can come to me anytime anytime at all for advice though it would probably be best if we kept that between ourselves pamela is a little annoyed with you just now he gave her an avuncular peck on the cheek a pat on the head then strolled out patient and placid he might be but he was also weak weak and though she hated to admit ithated to realize it after all these yearsselfish it took a selfish weakness to fire an efficient creative loyal employee on the whim of his wife she knew it was useless to cry but she cried a little anyway as she stood in the small office that shed decorated herself and boxed up her personal things her lifetime careerwise fit into a single storage box that was efficient again practical and malory decided pathetic everything was going to be different now and she wasnt ready she had no plan no outline no list for what came next she wouldnt be getting up tomorrow eating a light sensible breakfast dressing for work in the outfit carefully selected tonight day after day without purpose without plan stretched out in front of her like some bottomless canyon and the precious order of her life was strewn somewhere down there in the void it terrified her but marching along with the fear was pride so she repaired her makeup and kept her chin up her shoulders back as she carried the box out of the office and down the stairs she did her best to muster up a smile when tod grist rushed to the base of the stairs he was short and trim clad in his signature black shirt and pants two tiny gold hoops glinted in his left earlobe his hair was a shoulderlength streakyblond which malory had always envied the angelic face that it framed drew middleaged and elderly ladies like the sirens song drew sailors hed started at the gallery the year after malory arrived and had been her friend confidant and bitching partner ever since
