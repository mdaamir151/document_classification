of my predict have come true in mani part of the countri my messag howev could fall into the wrong hand of futur leader who could misus the prophesi or discard them which would emphas the opposit this would undermin the develop of mankind and for this reason i have hidden the prophesi in inimit quatrain as the old say goe do not cast pearl befor swine i have therefor use obscur and disord aphor in order not to damag the smallmind peopl in the present or the futur sometim i wish i could be silent yet i cant do anyth but pass on my insight it would be a sign of careless from my side becaus the hidden messag will serv the cours of human by show them their place onli initi will be abl to fathom the vers it is not for the averag person to know the given time and moment in order to lead and protect the common folk the creator will repeat reveal the secret of the futur and the past to pure know one revel of the divin work that are perfect the capac for clairvoy is receiv from the tender soul of the fire which can be touch dure the night rest the insight flow from that must not be confus with the natur knowledg of the live be the supernatur insight origin with the ether sourc and are

room empti i have sacrif my book full of secret wisdom to vulcanus in order to keep it danger power from the public when i burn the book the sky becam unusu clear and that show me it was a good decis god has favor me and i hope to be abl to pass on my inspir to you in spirit your father seem far away now but i am not remov further from heaven with my sens than i am from earth with my feet and dont

i was not hero materi i fell more along the line of archnemesi or supervillain i pour royal a glass of water in one of the giant beer stein i had behind the bar and thump it down in front of her without a word she jump a littl and i could see the regret and remors start to work it way into her face a pink flush was bloom over the expos crest of her cleavag and fill her cheek i made my way across the entir length of the bar stop to refil a coupl of drink close a tab clear some empti plate until i got to the kitchen entranc that took up the entir back part of the bar we typic onli serv

kind of fond for anyth at all she act like come to work each day was a prison sentenc which by default made me her jailer sinc i was her boss we didnt exact get along i think i saw too much of my old careless and thoughtless way reflect back at me when i interact with her i call avett name and when i didnt get an answer i prowl through the empti kitchen until i got to the massiv walkin fridg i didnt have time to screw around so i found some chees some bread and some random piec of fruit and figur that would have to do i need to shove someth into royal that would soak the booz up so i could tell her to get her head out of her ass and have the command stick i was kick the door close with the heel of my boot sinc my hand were full when the door to the beer cooler sudden pop open and avett came stroll out fiddl with the zipper on her obvious stuffedful messeng bag she stop dead in her track when she saw me her eye widen and then narrow in defianc what are you do back here the kitchen is

enough to retir on but it was enough that it shouldnt be gone in less than twentyfour hour unless she was up to no good instead of answer me she whirl around and went to put the beer back in the cooler i wait until she came back out and made her lead the way out of the kitchen back to the bar i had been gone long enough that the band was done with their set and that meant a crowd had gather and dixi was stand behind the bar tri to catch order up i nudg avett with my elbow and deposit my haul into her hand i point to royal who was sit stoic in the middl of the rush her head bent down and

awar of the effect it was have on the peopl around him he wasnt just troubl he was potent and more danger than most of the stuff i saw on the street everi day at some point the monotoni of wait for endless hour long into the night the quiet murmur of voic the squeak of rubber shoe on the linoleum floor all work togeth to lull me to sleep one minut i was think about how odd my night had turn out about how when i felt my absolut worst there was this remark foundat of wonder peopl to catch me i wasnt use to have ani kind of safeti net asid from dom and i had to admit it was realli nice to have

exact moment that his whole famili was there to meet him becaus it wasnt until the entir gang was present that reyer remington archer made his debut i had to say it was the best thing that had ever been wait for me on the end of the nightmarish vision of that horribl night and i would forev be grate i was allow to be part of it chapter 5 asa about two week after the night at the hospit i walk into the bar full of trepid rome had call and ask me to come in an hour earli becaus he want to talk to me about someth i couldnt for the life of me figur out if i had screw someth up or done someth

my sister and even though i could see she was happi realli happi with her choic to move in order to get more time with her man i miss her and i could see that she was still worri too much about me i tri to tell her that i was fine i tri to explain that if i was go to fuck up it wouldnt matter if she was here in denver or in austin but that just made her tawni eye spark at me in anger i love ayden more than i ever knew i was capabl of but i wasnt go to tri and fool her into believ that i was never go to screw up again all i could do was tri tri and be better tri and be honest tri stay on the right side of the law and not run when thing got hard tri was just go to have to be enough for ayden and for me dure the day the bar was fair quiet there was a whole slew of retir veteran that like to hang out and share old war stori it never ceas to amaz me how mani of them had to do with exwiv and old lover rather than ani actual war rome typic open the bar up and hung out until i got there in the earli even to run the night shift he want to be home with his famili dure the even and i couldnt say i blame him for that be a retir soldier himself rome had an easi way with the grizzl clientel and prefer to leav the more live and rambuncti parti crowd to me when i walk in the front door he wasnt around and brite the guy who had sold rome the bar in the first place was stand in my usual spot behind the long wooden bar darci the bar cook and brite exwif had her head poke out of the kitchen and the two of them appear to be argu in low voic i dont think either of them cop to the fact that they might be exe but were still practic marri wife number three was long gone and darci wasnt just his onli child mother but realli the love of his life i had ask rome about it onc and he just shrug and told me that good women were complic and hard to hold on to i didnt understand it until i walk into the liquor storeroom unannounc one day between shift and found darci with her leg in the air and brite giant form hover over her in an unmistak way there might not be ring but there was love and passion still there too bad their daughter was a gradea pain in the ass brite cut off whatev he was say to darci and she duck back into the kitchen his teeth flash at me through the mile of beard that cover his face and he cross his arm over his barrellik chest brite had so much dontfuckwithm pour off of him it alway surpris me how softspoken and insight he realli was he look like a hell angel not a savior but he was he had save this bar he had save rome he had given all those vet a place to

as my tongu sudden forgot how to work and all thought fled of cours there wouldnt be a fullsiz bath and shower in this tini apart just a shower stall enclos in bare frost glass that hid noth the steam from the shower wasnt enough to obscur the sight befor me and my hand push the door open the rest of the way like it was oper independ from the rest of me he had one arm bent abov his head with his forehead rest on it as the water cascad down around him he turn to look at me as the door open even with the shower steam and the hazi glass between us i could see his brilliant gaze lock on mine as his other arm move to work his fist up and down an impress erect that was obvious meant for me i knew i should shut the door and turn away it was his space his privat moment but i couldnt do it and i was equal part turn on and furious watch him as he work himself over all while he watch me unblink he was beauti it was beauti yet i was so mad that after all the way in which i had made it clear to

and i want to scream at him to stop to ask me to join him under the water and put that throb evid of his arous to better use but i was stun into silenc root to the spot by twin spike of passion and furi he was all long lean line and taut golden skin his blond hair was slick shade darker from the water and his eye shone out of his face like someth was light them up from deep within him the muscl in his arm and across his broad shoulder flex and danc as his hand move over the thick impatientlook arous that hung promin between his leg his defin ab contract then releas as he let out a long groan after a few more purpos stroke brought him to complet his entir bodi jerk just a littl and i could swear he mouth my name as he came but that might have been wish think on my part his fist relax and he blink slowli at me while reach out with a hand to push open the shower door we stare at each other for a long silent moment and i put a hand up to my throat becaus i felt like everyth i want to say
