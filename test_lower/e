a month later an extraordinary birth took place on planet earth a person with unprecedented prophetic gifts was born the astrologers birth in the village took place at the very beginning of the renaissance in the french town of saint rémy de provence in a stately mansion behind the market halls where the merchants had been hawking their wares for some time the contractions had started reynière de nostredame had carefully calculated the date of birth but the onset of labor still came unexpectedly the little one probably had a slightly earlier birth in mind in order to meet the optimum position of the planets the noticeably large mucus plug which closes off the cervix during pregnancy had just come out this was the sign that showed the end of the pregnancy was nearing reynière lost some blood and asked for her father jean de saint rémy to come her father was the court physician of the good king rené the former count of provence she lay on the bed perspiring and her husband jacques who had risen to the status of notary public hurriedly entered along with her father the contractions were now coming regularly and were becoming more painful until at their peak they suddenly stopped her father looked worried and felt his daughters belly with a professional touch relieved the physician established that the unborn child was still moving and that reynière was losing amniotic fluid at a normal rate regular contractions returned and the membranes broke labor was now well underway slowly but surely reynières body made an opening for the baby to move through the cervix which during pregnancy is drawn tight was now gradually opening the peculiar newcomer was fighting as if his life depended on it and the expulsion stage was exhausting the labor would take as many as ten hours finally the little head emerged the wideopen eyes critically taking in the world jean and jacques were amazed and looked at each other with great joy the shoulders were next after which the rest of the little body slid out without any problems michel his mother proudly welcomed the wet little bundle jean carefully picked up the slightly bloody baby who was still attached to the umbilical cord and put him on the mothers belly the boy was born with a caul with the membranes wrapped around the head clairvoyant children michel de nostredame appeared at exactly high noon on december 14 of the year 1503 with the church bells of saint rémy loudly ringing in the background his parents were overjoyed with their first child who would have a safe future as a catholic jacques and reynière were both descended from old jewish families but several years earlier all jews had been forced under pain of death to convert to catholicism there was still a menorah on the table however symbolizing the jewish festival of lights hanukkah that was being celebrated that month for these special holidays the tradition was secretly honored and jacques always read from the talmud this time he ceremoniously addressed his newborn son surrounded by the entire family and told him that the talmud speaks about the wonder of hanukah michel securely wrapped in swaddling cloths only heard some paternal sounds when the little one crawling and later walking began to discover the world he showed himself to be a very curious little boy he wanted to investigate everything in sight and examine every object he enthusiastically attacked visitors and sometimes liked to play with their hair he quickly expanded his boundaries to outdoors where he ignored the other children his age he thought they were playing aimlessly round and round once he extinguished the fire in the fireplace with water and sat there looking at the clouds of steam with great fascination during his first visit to the market his gift came to light the family was walking past the booths displaying wares because of his limited height michel was amusing himself with what was going on underneath the wooden tables fish remains rotting fruit blood waste broken jute sacs an occasional rat chewing on things and countless shuffling feet his mother was keeping a close eye on him the nostredame family stopped at a booth with glassware and wanted to buy something pretty for the holidays in the previous century one only saw drinking glasses among the socially elite but nowadays glass was being produced on a larger scale which made it more affordable the eager market merchant quickly grabbed the most delicate bowl between his teeth trying to impress the young mother you know madam pottery and wood and tin dishes are functional but very ugly glass dishes are all the rage now reynière cheerfully listened to him while keeping her child close by there are several types of glass drinking cups available he continued look at this gorgeous cups with hollow funnelshaped stems and low chalicetype glasses with tall graceful stems behind them are cylindershaped cups decorated with polka dots and what type is this she asked those are berkemeiers madam drinking glasses with a funnel shaped cup and a finely ridged foot ring the merchant took everything out of the cabinet because the family looked like they had money to spend jacques thought the ridged one were quite nice the ridged ones are very popular the merchant repeated immediately besides the low drinking bowls cabbage stalks and berkemeiers of course what are those ridges for inquired reynière the ridges or polka dots ensure a better grip on the glass and which ones do you sell most of asked her husband the glass drinking dishes sell especially well pouring devices such as bottles are very expensive the specialist apparently was the only person in the area who possessed a grand collection of glassware and he proudly brought out his most beautiful bottle the family was getting completely entranced by his products and jacques asked the man if he could look at the bottle more closely little michel had been behaving himself in a most exemplary fashion all this time and was quietly looking at the halffilled boxes under the table above jacques grabbed the glass showpiece clumsily and it immediately slipped out of his grasp the expected crash however surprisingly didnt come and everybodys startled attention focused below there their son had just effortlessly caught the very expensive bottle he put the heavenly gift to his lips whereupon the owner quickly grabbed it out of his little hands after many apologies the disillusioned family went home without buying anything when they got there the father who got away with just a scare was full of praise for his son his parents left the boys upbringing to his grandfather with the erudite jean he was in good hands the former court physician and astrologer taught his grandson not only mathematics but also ancient greek latin and hebrew as well as the preliminaries of astrology jean often took him outside the village at night so they could lie in the field together and look up at the stars there he told him that you can see the northern sky better in the winter and the southern sky in the summer and that the winter constellations such as the canis major and canis minoris can be easily found using the star orion as a guide when i grow up i want to be a star too said his grandson funny you should say that i was just thinking about the story where someone gets punished by being put in the sky as a star its about orion who was chasing his seven sisters the pleiades the sisters felt threatened by the chase and prayed for help which caused the goddess of the hunt to come to their rescue and she killed their brother with one of her arrows then orion was placed in the sky as a star but i dont know if thats possible for people made out of flesh and blood too michel although i just remembered there is some mention of it in the old scriptures so who knows by the way the pleiades are visible with the naked eye look theyre right there and jean stretched his arm toward the black sky those stars look like theyre touching each other the boy remarked yes it does look that way but in reality they are very far away from each other replied the grandfather when spring came around grandpa showed michel the stars arcturus regulus and the sparkling spica the brightest stars in the spring sky which together formed the spring triangle that summer the stars were not very clearly visible and it wasnt until autumn that grandfather showed the winged horse pegasus which is often difficult to find because it is upsidedown through these little excursions michel got to know the constellations and his parents kept grumbling that he and his grandfather came home so late at night one clear evening when jean had once again taken his grandson out the weather suddenly changed and turned gloomy no celestial bodies were visible and michel cursed the dark clouds that were gathering that night the little rascal was tossing and turning in his bed which was separated from other sleeping places with long curtains and couldnt sleep he was still angry and disappointed when suddenly the window shutters blew open and a furious tornado pulled him out of his bed he just managed to grab hold of the window sill with his body dangling outside reynière was woken up at that very moment by maternal instinct shook her husband awake and together they ran to the child who was in mortal peril together the two of them pulled the child back into the room and shut the window tightly not really realizing what had happened they went back to sleep and a short time later the window was pulled open once more again the whirlwind directed its energy toward the gifted child with a seething fury but his parents were there in a heartbeat and defeated the catastrophe before he was sucked out of the room the shutters were nailed shut permanently this was a lesson their son would never forget no more cursing anyone or anything he resolved one day a message arrived from pierre de nostredame michels paternal grandfather pierre and his wife lived in gra
